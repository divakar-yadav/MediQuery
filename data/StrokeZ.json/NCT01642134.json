Currently antithrombotic therapy after the procedure is not standardized. International treatment guidelines recommends that post-operative patients with a conventional surgical aortic bioprosthesis maintain oral anticoagulation for 3 months after the procedure, unless otherwise noted for its continuation. Whereas some studies have postulated that in patients with aortic bioprostheses, dual antiplatelet therapy is as effective to prevent major cardiac and cerebrovascular events as oral anticoagulation, with a lower incidence of bleeding complications at 3 months of treatment, the investigators formulated the following hypothesis:\n\n• There is a lower incidence of major cardiac and cerebrovascular events in patients with dual antiplatelet therapy compared to patients with oral anticoagulation for 3 months after implantation of an aortic bioprosthesis TAVI procedure."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aortic Valve Stenosis","Stroke"],"keywords":["Antiplatelet","Anticoagulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":124,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Duoplavin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Both active substances in DuoPlavin: clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid, are inhibitors of platelet aggregation.
