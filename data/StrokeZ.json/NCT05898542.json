Blood samples and microbiom samples of saliva, skin and feces are taken from all patients prior to interventions. These are controlled after 4 weeks from the beginning of the study and 3 months after signing-off the ward. Questionnaires eg on moods, life quality and function deficits are conducted in the beginning of the study, after 4 weeks from the start and 3 months after signing-off. Physiological measurements will be done to observe autonomic nerve status. The interventions consisting of therapy sessions in the hospital nearby nature will be conducted trice a week one of them being an individual nature-visit with the research worker, one in group and one with family-member or volunteer. The moods and quality of life of the family-member participating in the study will also be followed up. The control group is adviced to do simple, more conventional rehabilitative tasks indoors."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Rehabilitation","Stroke"],"keywords":["rehabilitation","stroke","nature-based","therapy","microbiom","gut-brain axis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomised controlled study, intervention and control groups","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Nature-based therapy intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients getting additional therapies outdoors","interventionNames":["Procedure: Nature-based therapy"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients getting additional rehabitation tasks indoors"}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Nature-based therapy","description":"Therapy sessions conducted outdoors","armGroupLabels":["Nature-based therapy intervention group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"PROMIS","description":"Functional deficits","timeFrame":"0-30 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"WHODAS","description":"Eg life quality","timeFrame":"0-30 days"},{"measure":"GAS","description":"Mental status","timeFrame":"0-120 days"},{"measure":"Therapeutic effects","description":"Core-10","timeFrame":"0-30 days"},{"measure":"Microbiom","description":"Microbial analyses of stool, saliva and flakes of skin","timeFrame":"0-120 days"},{"measure":"Nerve system activity","description":"A portable device measurement eg heart rate and activity","timeFrame":"0-30 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nAcute/Subacute stroke, rehabilitation ward patient\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nIncapable of independent decision making Traumatic bleeding in brain tissue Severe aphasia Severe, malign ongoing disease","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Hanna Haveri, MD PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+358444828225","email":"hanna.haveri@paijatha.fi"},{"name":"Marja Mikkelsson, Prof","role":"CONTACT","email":"marja.mikkelsson@paijatha.fi"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Hanna Haveri, MD PhD","affiliation":"Päijät-Hämeen Hyvinvointialue","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
