However, no studies have evaluated the interest of the development of therapeutic workshops in stroke unit to educate patients about symptoms suggestive of stroke, risk factors and what to do in cases of stroke.\n\nInvestigators assume that the setting up of a therapeutic education workshop in the stroke unit may allow a better understanding of the symptoms, risk factors and what to do following stroke. So there is a direct benefit to the patient represented by a better knowledge of stroke (warning signs, risk factors, what to do), improved treatment compliance and reduced risk of recurrence.\n\nMore generally, there is a real benefit to promote these messages to the public through the patient and his relatives"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":199,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Therapeutic Workshop","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Therapeutic Workshop (patients following therapeutic education workshops during their hospitalization)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: stroke education workshops"]},{"label":"Usual care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"stroke education workshops","armGroupLabels":["Therapeutic Workshop"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Questionnaire EPIC score","description":"The questionnaire score will concern knowledge of stroke risk factors, alert symptoms and what to do :\n\n1 point by quoted risk factor, 2 points by quoted symptom and 3 by quoted conduct","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Blood pressure","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"LDL-C","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Body Mass Index","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Smoking intoxication","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Recurrent stroke","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Compliance to treatments","timeFrame":"12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients older than 18 years.\n* Diagnosis of ischemic stroke;\n* Patients with back home or shorter rehabilitation;\n* Patients affiliated to a social security scheme;\n* Patients who consented to participate in writing.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with cognitive disorders, vigilance, aphasia.\n* Patients institutionalized.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Bertrand Lapergue, MD PhD","affiliation":"Hopital Foch","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Hopital Foch","city":"Suresnes","zip":"92150","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.87143,"lon":2.22929}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"34813082","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Crocker TF, Brown L, Lam N, Wray F, Knapp P, Forster A.
