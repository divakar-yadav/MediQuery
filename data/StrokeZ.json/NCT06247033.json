Participants are questioned if they have the symptoms of overactive bladder. After urodynamic evaluation, they are separated in 2 groups. Pelvic floor training exercises and bladder training are given in both groups; while one of the groups is followed with tibial nerve stimulation and the other one is followed with sham tibial nerve stimulation for 6 weeks.\n\nOur main aim was to compare effectiveness of tibial nerve stimulation in patiens with overactive bladder with stroke.","detailedDescription":"A sham-controlled double-blinded randomized study was undertaken. 28 patients with chronic stroke were randomized into 2 groups. Pelvic floor training exercises and bladder training are given in both groups; while one of the groups is followed with tibial nerve stimulation and the other one is followed with sham tibial nerve stimulation for 6 weeks.\n\nIn both groups, patients are followed for completing the standart schedule of PFTE and BT; and excluded from our study if their rates below %80 according to exercise and training schedule.\n\nStudy group was followed with tibial nerve stimulation for 6 weeks, 2 sessions in a week, for 30 minutes. Stimulation was performed with TENS device, with settings of 10 Hz frequency, 200 msn wavelenght, continuous symetrical biphasic current. Amptlitude was increased just below the motor range that cause flexion in toes.\n\nControl group was followed with sham tibial nerve stimulation, which were performed by after starting electric current with TENS device, current were decreased and completely shut off. Sham stimulation was also applied for 6 weeks, 2 times in a week, 30 minutes.\n\nAfter 6 weeks, both groups were evaluated with urodynamic study for the second time.\n\nICIQ-SF, King's Health Questionaire, Overactive Bladder Syndrome Symptom Scoring and urodynamic study parameters were examined in both pre- and post-treatment period.\n\nResults were compared to see if there is any difference in the patients who followed with TNS and also pre-post treatment symptoms with PFTE and BT."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Incontinence, Urge","Stroke","Neurogenic Bladder"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":28,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active TNS - Chronic stroke patients with urgency symptoms, followed with PFTE, BT, TNS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Study group was followed with tibial nerve stimulation for 6 weeks, 2 sessions in a week, for 30 minutes.
