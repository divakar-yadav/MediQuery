In detail, the anodal stimulation on the impaired hemisphere will be used associated with a robotic treatment.","detailedDescription":"As for transcranial direct current stimulation a HDC kit (ATES/EB NEURO, Firenze, Italy) will be used as device. It is a new device generation of stimulator able to provide an effective stimulation pattern.\n\nAs robotic device the InMotion wrist robot (Interactive Motion Technologies Inc., Watertown, MA, USA) will be used.
