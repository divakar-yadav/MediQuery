SOC for the treatment of EHS is defined as effective body cooling, which should be implemented as quickly as available after diagnosis of exertional heat stroke.","detailedDescription":"The study will take place at emergency medical facilities.\n\nDue to the life-threatening nature of exertional heat stroke (EHS), rapid assessment for inclusion into the study and subsequent immediate treatment must occur. Following initial triage and primary assessment of a subject, the subject's baseline status should be documented, and once a diagnosis of EHS is obtained, SOC treatment will be initiated immediately, the subject will be randomized to one of two treatment arms (SOC only or SOC plus Ryanodex).\n\nPatients will be remain hospitalized for up to 72 hours after administration of the first dose of study drug and implemented SOC and will receive all necessary supportive measures until resolution of symptoms.\n\nStudy duration: 72 hours"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Heat Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ryanodex","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Ryanodex (dantrolene sodium) for injectable suspension administered as an IV bolus, in addition to standard of care (SOC) treatment.","interventionNames":["Drug: Dantrolene sodium for injectable suspension"]},{"label":"Standard of Care only (SOC)","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Standard of Care (SOC) treatment only, consisting of body cooling and supportive measures implemented immediately."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Dantrolene sodium for injectable suspension","description":"Ryanodex will be administered as a rapid IV push as a single doses of 2 mg/kg or as 1 mg/kg.","armGroupLabels":["Ryanodex"],"otherNames":["Ryanodex; EGL-4104"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Subjects Achieving Recovery of Level of Consciousness Defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) GCS ≥ 13","description":"Number of subjects achieving a Glasgow Coma Scale(GCS) ≥ 13 at or prior to 90 minutes post-randomization.
