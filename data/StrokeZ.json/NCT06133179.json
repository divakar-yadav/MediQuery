Visualization of these vessels would allow us to conclude on the presence, or absence, of an ischemic stroke in the region of the middle cerebral artery.\n\nTo answer the question asked, 20 participants who suffered a stroke will carry out a transtemporal ultrasound examination specifically for research in the 7 days following his stroke. The data obtained will be analyzed by the CNRS medical imaging laboratory, in order to characterize the presence of a stroke and to compare the data obtained with that of standard examinations (CT and MRI)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral
