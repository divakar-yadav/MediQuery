The PACT-Q2 is composed of three dimensions covering: convenience (11 items), burden of disease and treatment (2 items), and anticoagulant treatment satisfaction (7 items). Items for convenience and for burden of disease and treatment were reversed (reversed score = 6 - item score), added together and rescaled on a 0-100 scale to obtain the convenience dimension score (CDS). Items for anticoagulant treatment satisfaction are summed and rescaled on a 0-100 scale to determine the satisfaction dimension score (SDS). High scores are more favorable.

The PACT-Q2 is composed of three dimensions covering: convenience (11 items), burden of disease and treatment (2 items), and anticoagulant treatment satisfaction (7 items). Items for convenience and for burden of disease and treatment were reversed (reversed score = 6 - item score), added together and rescaled on a 0-100 scale to obtain the convenience dimension score (CDS). Items for anticoagulant treatment satisfaction are summed and rescaled on a 0-100 scale to determine the satisfaction dimension score (SDS). High scores are more favorable. The two dimension scores are presented for Baseline, Visit 2 (second assessment) and Visit 3 (last assessment) as mean and standard deviation (SD).","populationDescription":"Eligible patients: All patients who took the prescribed treatment and without specific important protocol violations are eligible.

A3: Do you expect that your anticoagulant treatment will cause side effects such as minor bruises or bleeding? A4: How important is it for you to have an anticoagulant treatment that is easy to take? A5: How concerned are you about making mistakes when taking your anticoagulant treatment? A6: How important is it for you to take care of your anticoagulant treatment by yourself?
