Recently, theta-gamma tACS has been shown to enhance motor skill acquisition in healthy individuals \\[Akkad et al.2021\\]. The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of theta-gamma tACS on motor skill acquisition in chronic stroke patients.\n\nIn a randomized, controlled, triple-blind trial, chronic stroke patients with an initially impaired hand motor function will receive either (i) theta-gamma peak stimulation (TGP) or (ii) sham stimulation. TGP stimulation significantly improved motor learning in the study by Akkad et al (2021) compared to sham stimulation. tACS will be delivered through a five-electrode montage centered over the sensorimotor cortex on the lesioned side of the brain for approximately 38 min. During stimulation patients will perform a motor skill acquisition task performed with the affected hand. The task consists of short repetitive trials in which participants alternately press two buttons with their thumb. It is designed in a way that participants can improve their performance, more precisely the speed of button presses, and are encouraged to do so. To reduce skin sensations beneath the stimulation electrodes and thereby improve blinding compared to sham stimulation, a local anesthetic consisting of lidocaine and prilocaine will be administered underneath the stimulation electrodes.\n\nBased on the results of the study by Akkad et al. (2021) and on the assumption that theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling is a key mechanism for motor skill acquisition, the investigators hypothesize that motor skill acquisition will differ significantly between the TGP and sham group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Hand motor impairment","Transcranial alternating current stimulation","Non-invasive brain stimulation","motor learning","sensorimotor cortex","crossfrequency coupling","theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"TGP-tACS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients perform a motor skill acquisition task with the affected hand during TGP-stimulation over the sensorimotor cortex on the lesioned side.","interventionNames":["Device: TGP-tACS"]},{"label":"Sham-tACS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients perform a motor skill acquisition task with the affected hand during sham-stimulation over the sensorimotor cortex on the lesioned side.","interventionNames":["Device: Sham-tACS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"TGP-tACS","description":"38 min and 20s of 4mA peak-to-peak theta-gamma stimulation with 75 Hz-gamma coupled to the peak of 6Hz-theta waves. 3s ramp-up at the beginning of stimulation and 3s ramp-down at the end of stimulation.\n\nAdministered using a Starstim® device and 5 gel electrodes with a πcm² area.","armGroupLabels":["TGP-tACS"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham-tACS","description":"38 min and 20s of alternation between 10s of 4mA peak-to-peak TGP- tACS and a 6 min 30s stimulation-free interval.
