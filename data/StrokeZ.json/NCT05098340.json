The candidate circRNA will be verified as biomarkers for the detection and prognosis of acute ischemic stroke.","detailedDescription":"Circular RNAs have been highlighted to be involved in the pathological process of ischemic stroke (IS). The purpose of this protocol will investigate the expression pattern of circular RNA (circRNA) by bioinformatics analysis in patients with acute ischemic stroke and healthy control. The candidate circRNA will be verified as biomarkers for the detection and prognosis of acute ischemic stroke. Distinctive expression patterns of circRNA will be identified by individual quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A diagnostic or predictive model will be established using logistic regression. The panel of these altered circRNAs may be associated with acute IS and could serve as a novel diagnostic or predictive method."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic
