The main purpose is to identify the post-stroke life pathways components associated with sequalae at 3 months and 1 year after the acute stroke episode.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is a serious health event, involving the entire health care system and generating considerable socioeconomic weight for society. Knowledge of the components, the diversity and the scalability of post-stroke life pathways is currently not sufficient. Moreover the link between post-stroke pathways and patient sequelae have not yet been clearly defined.\n\nThe main purpose is to identify the post-stroke life pathways components associated with sequalae at 3 months and 1 year after the acute stroke episode. The secondary objectives are: 1) To define a typology of the life pathways of stroke patients, , 2) To analyze the social and geographical inequalities in the management of stroke, 4) To estimate the cost of the pathway elements of stroke management; 5) Measure the sequelae of stroke patients at three months and one year after the acute episode.\n\nThe design is a prospective multicenter cohort study with a follow up to 1 year after the acute episode, managed in several hospitals in the Aquitaine region (France)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke Sequelae"],"keywords":["Stroke","Pathways","Sequelae","Health services research"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1138,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Telephone Interview","description":"Telephone Interview"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) Score","description":"Activity limitations post-stroke measure.
