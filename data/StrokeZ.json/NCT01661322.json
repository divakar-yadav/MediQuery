Existing prevention strategies (antithrombotic, lipid/blood pressure lowering, endarterectomy) reduce, not abolish, further events. Dual antiplatelet therapy - aspirin \\& clopidogrel (AC) for IHD, aspirin \\& dipyridamole (AD) for stroke, is superior to aspirin monotherapy. The investigators hypothesise that triple antiplatelet therapy (ACD) will be superior to AD in patients at high-risk of recurrence, providing bleeding does not become excessive.\n\nDesign: TARDIS is a multicentre, parallel-group, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint, controlled trial. In the start-up phase, the investigators will assess over 3 years the safety, tolerability and feasibility of intensive therapy (ACD) versus guideline therapy (AD) given for 1 month in 750 patients with acute stroke/TIA. The main phase will then assess the safety and efficacy of ACD in up to 3500 patients. The primary outcome is ordinal stroke (fatal/severe non-fatal/mild/TIA/none) at 90 days. Secondary outcomes include death, MI, vascular events, function, bleeding, serious adverse events; sub-studies will assess cerebral emboli and platelet function.","detailedDescription":"2.1 Purpose To perform a randomised trial assessing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of intensive antiplatelet therapy (Asp+Dip+Clop) versus guideline antiplatelet therapy (Asp+Dip or Clop) in patients with recent ischaemic stroke or TIA and who are at high risk of recurrence.\n\n2.2 Primary Objective To assess ordinal stroke severity at 90 days after short-term administration (1 month) of intensive antiplatelet therapy versus guideline therapy in patients with very recent ischaemic stroke or TIA.\n\n2.3 Secondary Objectives\n\n1. To assess the safety of short-term administration (1 month) of intensive antiplatelet therapy versus guideline therapy in patients with very recent ischaemic stroke or TIA.\n2.
