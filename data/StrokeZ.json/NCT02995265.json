The exoskeleton will allow standing and walking from the first sessions in rehabilitation, as the exoskeleton provides the physical support to allow walking in full weight-bearing without being limited by therapist fatigue and lifting requirements. Individuals in the Usual Care Program will receive standard physiotherapy care, which is individualized and hands-on with their therapist to regain walking, mobility, and independent function.\n\nBoth groups will be conducted 3-5 days a week, 30-60 minutes per session until discharge (to a maximum of 8 weeks). Participants will be assessed at baseline, discharge, and 6-months after starting rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Conditions"],"keywords":["Exoskeleton","Stroke","Walking","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exoskeleton Program","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Exoskeleton-based walking rehabilitation until discharge (or to a maximum of 8 weeks), 3 - 5 days a week for 30-60 minutes per session.
