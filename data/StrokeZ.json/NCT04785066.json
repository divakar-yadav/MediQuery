However, this complete reperfusion is only obtained in 60% of patients. Most often, incomplete reperfusion is due to the persistence of distal occlusions, which are inaccessible to mechanical thrombectomy. Drug treatment, combined with thrombectomy to increase the rate of complete reperfusion, would be a major advance in the management of these patients.\n\nThis is a non-randomized, monocentric, open-label, phase II trial to evaluate efficacy of dornase alfa intravenous administration in patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis and eligible for thrombectomy for ischemic stroke of the anterior circulation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic
