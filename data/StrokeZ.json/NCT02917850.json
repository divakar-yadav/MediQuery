Hip flexor deficit is one of the more prevalent trouble and is associated with gait capacities. This study aims at evaluating the impact of an isokinetic hip flexors strengthening rehabilitation program in the subacute phase after stroke. Patients will be randomized to an intervention group (isokinetic rehabilitation) or a control group (conventional rehabilitation) and assessed at the end of the rehabilitation program, at 3 and at 6 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiplegia","Gait"],"keywords":["stroke","gait","hip flexors","paresis","hemiplegia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Isokinetic","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients who benefit from the hip flexors isokinetic strengthening rehabilitation program","interventionNames":["Procedure: Isokinetic hip flexors strengthening","Procedure: Conventional rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients who benefit from a conventional rehabilitation program","interventionNames":["Procedure: Conventional rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Isokinetic hip flexors strengthening","description":"Isokinetic excentric strengthening of paretic hip flexors, 3/w during 6 weeks, in addition to conventional rehabilitation 7/w.","armGroupLabels":["Isokinetic"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Conventional rehabilitation","description":"Conventional rehabilitation 10/w during 6 weeks","armGroupLabels":["Control","Isokinetic"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Max gait speed (m/s)","description":"Gait speed will be assessed in the 10m walk test","timeFrame":"6 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Max gait speed (m/s)","description":"Gait speed will be assessed in the 10m walk test","timeFrame":"3 and 6 months"},{"measure":"Hip flexors strength","description":"Hip flexors strength will be evaluated using an isokinetic dynamometer (concentric, 30Â°/s) and motor testing (medical research council)","timeFrame":"6weeks;
