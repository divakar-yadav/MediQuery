Moreover, we expect to evaluate the safety of using Y-6 sublingual tablet in such study population.","detailedDescription":"This study rationale is based on the following scheme: in patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by LVO, receiving reperfusion therapy may cause futile recanalization and thus lead to microcirculation dysfunction and thrombo-inflammation as consequences. Cilostazol has antiplatelet effects and BBB protection and Dexborneol has anti-inflammatory effects; therefore, the multi-component tablet may exert neuroprotective effects in terms of improving microcirculation dysfunction and reducing thrombo-inflammation in patients with AIS after reperfusion therapy.\n\nThe primary purpose of this study is to investigate the proportion of modified-Rankin scale (mRS) score recovered to 0\\~1 score at 90±7 days after randomization.\n\nThe follow-up duration is 3 months, and the visit schedule is as follows: Subjects enrolled based on randomization procedures will receive visits at screening/baseline period, 24 ± 2 hours, 7 ± 2 days, 28 + 3 days and 90 ± 7 days after randomization, and in case of any events."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Large Vessel Occlusion","Reperfusion"],"keywords":["Y-6","cilostazol","dexborneol","acute ischemic stroke","large vessel
