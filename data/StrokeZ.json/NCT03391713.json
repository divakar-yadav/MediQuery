The control group study will be conducted in the first two weeks. Subsequently, the intervention arm will occur in the subsequent two weeks.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is a major health problem and a known cause of death and disability worldwide. In Malaysia, stroke is known to be top five causes of death and top ten causes of hospitalization Malaysia. Ischemic stroke accounts for more than 95% of all stroke cases (1). A recent study done in Malaysia showed that only 26% of patients with stroke symptoms presented to the hospital within 3 hours. One of the reasons was patients did not perceive the symptoms of stroke as being that of a serious illness (2). One of the modalities to raise awareness of stroke is through an educational poster. Posters in the waiting room can increase awareness of health promotion issues (3). Therefore, by placing poster regarding sign and symptoms of stroke in the waiting room in a government clinic, can increase awareness of early presentation of stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["awareness","poster","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1064,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"No exposure to waiting room posters"},{"label":"Intervention","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"During the second half of the study (two weeks), there will be an education poster in the waiting room of the clinic, fashioned after the Face, Arms, Speech, Time (FAST) poster developed by the American Heart Association (AHA), but in Malay.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Poster"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Poster","description":"The poster includes the FAST symptoms but translated to the Malay language (Ce.P.A.T) Cakap tak jelas (slurred speech - Speech slurring) Perubahan muka (face changes - Face drooping) Anggota lemah (weak limbs - Arm weakness) Terus ke Hospital (straight to the hospital - Time to call 911","armGroupLabels":["Intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Awareness of the signs and symptoms of stroke","description":"Participants awareness of the signs and symptoms of stroke as assessed by a questionnaire.
