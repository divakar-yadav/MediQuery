In this study, simultaneous stimulation using both facilitatory rTMS (10Hz) and anodal or cathodal tDCS (dual-mode stimulation) over bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFCs) was investigated to compare its modulatory effects with single facilitatory rTMS stimulation in post-stroke cognitive impairment patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post-stroke Cognitive
