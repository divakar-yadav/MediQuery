Each item is rated from 0% (no confidence) to 100% (complete confidence). Elderly respondents are asked to rate their confidence that they will lose their balance or become unsteady in the course of daily activities. ABC is an 11-point scale and ratings should consist of whole numbers (0-100) for each item. Participants should indicate their level of confidence in doing an activity without losing balance or becoming unsteady by choosing one of the percentage points on the scale from 0%-100%. Total the ratings (possible range = 0 to 1600) and divide by 16 to get each subject's ABC score. Scores lower than 50 indicate a low level of functioning, scores above 50 but below 80 indicate a medium level, and those over 80 indicate a high level of functioning.","timeFrame":"Pre-intervention time: one week before the intervention period (4 week).Post intervention time:immediately after the intervention.
