We hypothesize that participants in this home-based tele-exercise training program will achieve similar gains in health and function outcomes as the onsite exercise training program. Further, there will be no difference in adverse side effects (safety) between the home-based and onsite exercise treatment groups.","detailedDescription":"TExT-ME is a home-based tele-exercise study providing a novel exercise program to participants with neurologic disabilities. The exercise curriculum is a Movement 2 Music (M2M) program developed during phase 2 of the grant (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02533882). The exercise exercise classes are taught by trained dance instructors and are composed of a set of exercises tailored to the specific needs and capabilities of adults with neurologic disability. Each set of exercises is performed to high and low tempo music based on the individual's baseline level of function, with adjustments made to increase or decrease intensity if needed. The class consists of several training components: a) warmup (10 min.) to increase range of motion; strength/balance (15-20 min), aerobics (25-30 min. with rest periods as necessary); cool down (5 min).\n\nThe TExT-ME training and monitoring system is a user-centered design (UCD) involving a tele-exercise coach (e.g., a trained research staff person) interacting remotely with a participant in their home using video conferencing programs. Participants wear monitors to maintain safe levels of exercise and provide feedback regarding exercise intensity to the instructors. Self-reported indicators of exercise intensity are also collected using rating of perceived exertion."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Multiple Sclerosis","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":27,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Home-Based Movement to Music","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The Movement to Music classes are composed of a set of exercises tailored to the specific needs and capabilities of each target group.
