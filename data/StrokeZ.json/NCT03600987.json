A single-subject adapted alternating treatment design will be used to compare two music conditions, using music with sung lyrics simultaneously with reading of the lyrics, and priming with music and sung lyrics followed by a reading of the lyrics, with a control condition using reading lyrics without music. Results are expected to provide evidence of independent versus shared processing of music and language at the phrase level applied to the behavior of human subjects with aphasia.","detailedDescription":"Quality assurance plan that addresses data validation and registry procedures, including any plans for site monitoring and auditing.\n\nData checks to compare data entered into the registry against predefined rules for range or consistency with other data fields in the registry.\n\nData verification to assess the accuracy, completeness, or representativeness of data by comparing the data to external data sources (reliability) Data dictionary: detailed descriptions of each variable Standard Operating Procedures: patient recruitment, data collection, data management, data analysis, reporting for adverse events change management. Sample size: A minimum of four participants will be required to demonstrate replication of treatment effects. A maximum of ten participants will be requested to account for attrition.\n\nPlan for missing data, data inconsistency,or out-of-range results.
