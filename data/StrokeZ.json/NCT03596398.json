No randomization procedure will be executed in this study. Approximately 1000 subjects over a 36-month period. The aim of this screening study is to identify the Fabry disease as the cause in patients with young stroke.\n\nTo measure the level of Î±-Gal A activity, male subjects will initially provide a DBS sample and female subjects will start with a test by whole blood sample.\n\nThe prevalence of Fabry disease among patients with young stroke will be estimated by a confirmative diagnosis in gene testing."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fabry Disease"],"keywords":["Fabry disease","Young
