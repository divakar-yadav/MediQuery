Then, Trunk Impairment Scale, Trunk Control Test, Function in Sitting Test, and \"Fugl Meyer Upper Extremity Test\" will be applied respectively.\n\nThirty patients with stroke will included in the study. Trunk Impairment Scale and Trunk Control Test will used to assess trunk control assessment. Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the upper extremity will used to assess upper extremity. Function in Sitting Test will used to assess sitting balance. To evaluate between correlation trunk control and upper extremity and sitting balance will used to correlation analysis tests"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["upper extremity","stroke","trunk control","sitting balance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":68,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Assessment","description":"Evaluations will be made once."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Trunk Impairment Scale","description":"It is a scale developed for the evaluation of the trunk after stroke.

It consists of 4 parts. The test consists of the parameters of turning from the supine position to the weak and strong side, coming from the supine position to the sitting position and maintaining the sitting balance.
