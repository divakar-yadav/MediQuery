To investigate the short- and long-term treatment effects of action observation, imagery, and execution therapy (AOIE) compared with an action observation therapy (AO) group and a control treatment group as controls on different aspects of outcomes in patients with stroke.\n2. To examine the neural mechanisms and changes in cortical neural activity after the interventions in stroke patients.\n3. To examine the correlations between AOIE-induced brain activation changes and the clinical efficacy of AOIE.\n4. To identify who are the possible good responders to the therapy based on baseline motor function and motor imagery ability of the participants.","detailedDescription":"The investigators propose a 3-year randomized controlled trial to (1) investigate the short- and long-term treatment efficacy of AOIE, action observation alone, versus control treatment on clinical outcomes of patients with subacute stroke, (2) examine the neural mechanisms and activation changes after the 3 interventions by using an advanced brain imaging technique, magnetoencephalography (MEG), (3) determine the correlations between neural activation changes and clinical outcomes, and (4) identify who are the good responders to the AOIE therapy. An estimated total of 96 patients with subacute stroke will be recruited in this study. All participants will be randomly assigned to receive 1 of the 3 interventions for 3 weeks (a total of 15 sessions). Clinical outcome measures will be conducted at baseline, immediately after treatment (3 weeks), and at 3 months follow-up. The MEG assessment will be conducted at baseline and immediately after treatment (3 weeks). For the MEG study, The investigators anticipate to enroll 12 to 15 patients in each group to complete neuroimaging evaluation because of the specific eligibility criteria and high costs of MEG. The patients can still participate in the study, receiving rehabilitation therapy and clinical evaluations, even if the participants will not be included in the MEG study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","neurorehabilitation","mirror neuron system","action observation","motor imagery","MEG"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":17,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Action observation, imagery & execution","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Action observation, imagery & execution"]},{"label":"Action observation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Action observation"]},{"label":"Control treatment","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Control treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Action observation, imagery & execution","description":"The participants will be asked to observe movements through a video clip, practice motor imagery, and executing the movements that the participants observed.","armGroupLabels":["Action observation, imagery & execution"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Action observation","description":"The participants will be asked to observe videos and then practice what the participants observed.","armGroupLabels":["Action observation"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Control treatment","description":"The participants will receive UE training without watching videos or imagining movements/tasks.","armGroupLabels":["Control treatment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change scores of Modified Rankin Scale","description":"The Modified Rankin Scale is used to assess the degree of stroke disability.","timeFrame":"baseline, 3 weeks , 3 months"},{"measure":"Change scores of Fugl-Meyer Assessment","description":"Change from baseline motor impairment at 3 weeks on the Fugl-Meyer Assessment.","timeFrame":"baseline, 3 weeks , 3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change scores of Box and Block Test","description":"The Box and Block Test is a measure of hand dexterity with satisfactory reliability and validity in patients with stroke.","timeFrame":"baseline, 3 weeks , 3 months"},{"measure":"Change scores of Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory (CAHAI)","description":"The CAHAI measures the upper-limb motor function after stroke.","timeFrame":"baseline, 3 weeks , 3 months"},{"measure":"Change scores of Movement Imagery Questionnaire, revised second version","description":"The MIQ-RS will be applied to assess patient's ability of motor imagery.","timeFrame":"baseline, 3 weeks , 3 months"},{"measure":"Change scores of Functional Independence Measure","description":"The Functional Independence Measure is a frequently used scale to assess basic activities of daily function.","timeFrame":"baseline, 3 weeks , 3 months"},{"measure":"Change scores of physical intensity measured by activity monitors","description":"The accelerometers (ActiGraph) are used to provide an objective measure of the amount of the affected arm in patient's real-life environments.
