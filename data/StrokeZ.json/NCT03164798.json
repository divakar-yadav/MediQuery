Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) acts on certain neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) helping to support the survival of existing neurons, and encourage the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses. BDNF in CNS can be assessed by analysing serum BDNF. The final objective of this study is to demonstrate a role of biomarker of BDNF in stroke rehabilitation to establish the individualized strategy.","detailedDescription":"Serum BDNF, proBDNF and MMP-9 in all participants will be measured before and after the comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation during subacute stroke phase. At 3 months after stroke onset, serum BDNF, proBDNF and MMP-9 will also be measured.\n\nIn addition, motor impairment with Fugl-Meyer assessement will be assessed at same time points with serum analysis.\n\nWe will compare potential serum biomarkers with motor impairment in stroke patients"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Biomarker","Rehabilitation","BDNF"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"BDNF Val66Met polymorphism"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Conventional inpatient rehabilitation","description":"comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation for 2 weeks"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Serum BDNF","description":"serum BDNF level","timeFrame":"At 2 weeks after the comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Serum proBDNF","description":"Serum proBDNF level","timeFrame":"At 2 weeks after the comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation"},{"measure":"MMP-9","description":"MMP-9 level","timeFrame":"At 2 weeks after the comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* unilateral stroke patients\n* admission to the rehabilitation department before 1 month after stroke onset\n* mild to severe motor impairment at time of transferring to the rehabilitation department\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Progressive or unstable stroke\n* Pre-existing and active major neurological disease\n* Pre-existing and active major psychiatric disease\n* Advanced liver, kidney, cardiac, or pulmonary disease\n* A terminal medical diagnosis consistent with survival \\< 1 year)\n* Pregnant or lactating woman","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"19 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Subacute stroke patients who were received the comprehensive inpatients rehabilitation","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Won Hyuk Chang, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Samsung Medical Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Samsung Medical Center","city":"Seoul","zip":"135-710","country":"Korea, Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":37.566,"lon":126.9784}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"24767962","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Chang WH, Bang OY, Shin YI, Lee A, Pascual-Leone A, Kim YH.
