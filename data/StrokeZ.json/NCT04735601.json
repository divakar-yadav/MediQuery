Suprachoroidal hemorrhage or detachment is a challenging complication which must be encountered.\n\nThe usage of Ahmed valve in the management of glaucoma associated with Sturge weber syndrome is a bleb based procedure carries the risks of over filtration or encapsulation and decreased filtration with failure to control glaucoma.\n\nThe use of Ahmed valve in the management of pediatric glaucoma associated with Sturge weber syndrome has better results as recorded by Nassiri et al. Ahmed valve implantation can have some drawbacks such as pupillary irregularity, lens opacification, or encapsulation.(4-7) Glaucoma drainage devices such as Ahmed valve, Molteno or Braeveldt valve can be used when other methods of treatment fail, they provide alternative pathway to the aqueous to be collected in a plate positioned under the conjunctiva, (8-10) Encapsulation is a major problem occurs around the end plate due to fibrous reaction and so the drainage of the aqueous is decreased , Epatein (11) attributed that to fibro vascular proliferation in the episcleral tissue .the fibrous reaction is multifactorial , it may be due to the size of the end plate, the biomaterial, design or the shape of the plate.\n\nThe use of drainage devices with advanced drug delivery system can improve the success of drainage device.\n\nA double-layered porous coating for Ahmed glaucoma valves based on biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) was described by Ponnusamy et al. \\[12\\] to produce continuous release of antifibrotic agents \\[mitomycin C (MMC) and/or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)\\] to the subconjunctival space. This release continue for about one month with decreasing fibrosis, the nanofiltration membrane could entrap the proteins passing out from the anterior chamber leading to minimal increase in aqueous resistance.(12-13)","detailedDescription":"All participants will be evaluated regarding the following:\n\nVisual acuity (VA) will be measured before and after surgery. Visual field (VF) will be assessed. Optical coherence topography (OCT) Ahmed valve coated with PLGA nanoparticles saturated with Mitomycin-C 2mg/ml. Follow up will continue for one year regarding intraocular pressure IOP, VA , VF, OCT and occurrence of complications such as erosion, extrusion, infection, encapsulation and fibrosis around the stent.\n\nData will be collected and
