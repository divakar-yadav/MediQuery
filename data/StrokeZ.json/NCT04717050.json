Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the intervention is being studied. The purpose of this research is to determine whether a 16-week exercise program will improve fitness and lessen risk factors related to coronary artery disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes in patients who have breast cancer and is sustainable for a Latina population to incorporate into their lifestyle following completion of the 16-week intervention.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nParticipants in this study will be randomly assigned into one of the study groups: Progressive Combine Training (PCT) or Attention Control.\n\n* Progressive combined training (PCT) will be performed in 2 phases:\n\n  1. supervised 16-week resistance and cardiovascular exercise at a local YMCA (months 1-4) or remotely at home via Zoom.\n  2. unsupervised 16-week resistance and cardiovascular exercise at a local YMCA (months 5-8) or remotely at home with weekly check-ins with trainer.\n* Attention Control Group: 51 weeks home-based stretching\n\nAll participants will undergo seven blood draws and participate in nine testing visits.\n\nParticipation is expected to last 12 months for all participants.\n\nIt is expected that about 160 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThe American Cancer Society is supporting this research study by providing funding for the research study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Breast Cancer","Coronary Artery Disease","Stroke","Type2 Diabetes"],"keywords":["Breast Cancer","Coronary Artery Disease","Stroke","Type2 Diabetes","Exercise Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":160,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Progressive combine training (PCT)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will be randomly assigned to Progressive combine training (PCT) group.\n\nParticipants will have two (2) baseline tests, then begin a two phase PCT program.\n\n* Phase 1: Supervised 16-week resistance and cardiovascular exercise at a local YMCA (months 1-4) or remotely at home via Zoom\n* Participants will receive midpoint testing, approximately week 8.\n* Phase 2: Unsupervised 16-week resistance and cardiovascular exercise at a local YMCA (months 5-8) or remotely at home\n* Participants will receive midpoint testing, approximately two months into phase 2.\n\nAfter the two (2) 16-week phases, participants will be followed for 4 months.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Progressive combine training (PCT)"]},{"label":"Attention Control (AC)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will be randomly assigned to Attention Control (AC) group.\n\nTwo (2) baseline tests will be performed prior to starting the program.
