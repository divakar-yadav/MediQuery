This is a validation study, aiming to determine during which of two activities VO2 measurements better express the functional restrictions caused by stroke, And to find out whether the Total Heart Beat Index can be used in the case of stroke survivors for the prediction of mechanical efficiency when measured during stair-climbing and of energy cost during treadmill walking.\n\nThe hypothesis is that Stair Climbing (STC) is a more suitable form of exercise capacity testing compared to Treadmill Walk (TMW) since it potentially requires a greater amount of external work, and therefore will show stronger correlation with functional tests demonstrating the same ability, whereas TMW does not utilize the movement capability of participants to the fullest.\n\nAnother hypothesis is that cardiac response to the exertion can be used as a predictor of those measures during these exertions in the post stroke population."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiplegia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"People with Post Stroke Conditions","description":"(a) having acquired stroke at least 1 year before testing.
