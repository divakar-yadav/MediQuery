The optimal One-stop management from admission to recanalization associated with reduction of in-hospital times. The development of ﬂat-detector computed tomography perfusion capable angio-suite allowed One-stop management to be improved treatment time better and better. To compare One-stop management versus our standard workflow in shortening door-to-recanalization time.","detailedDescription":"Acute ischemic stroke is one of the diseases associated with stroke onset time, especially in the case of large vessel occlusion within 6 hours. This is the reason why endovascular reperfusion therapy (mechanical thrombectomy, angioplasty, stent,...) is recommended to be performed as soon as possible in the comprehensive stroke centers. The successful recanalization within 6 hours demonstrated the efficacy that helps to improve the functional outcome by trials. Besides, the strategies shortening time from admission to successful recanalization are essential for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion. Nevertheless, the optimizing door-to-groin puncture and door to recanalization Time are the great challenge to benefit most patients with the endovascular therapy. In recent years, the One - stop management (direct transport to the angiosuite workflow) which means that the recanalization therapy is considered to perform immediately based on the diagnostic angiograms and perfusion maps relating to acute ischemic stroke caused by large vessel occlusion by the ﬂat-detector computed tomography at the angiosuite at the same time. We hypothesized that one-stop management is feasible and reduces more intrahospital time delays than our standard workflow previously published."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","angiosuite","reperfusion times","One-stop"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A prospective, randomized, controlled, single blind when patients are only blinded to the allocation, our clinical trial was conducted comparing One-stop (OS) management with our standard workflow (SW) in treatment of acute ischemic stroke from 12/2022 - 11/2023 at Can Tho SIS General Hospital.
