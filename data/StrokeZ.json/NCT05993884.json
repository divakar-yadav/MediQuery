However, due to the limitation of time and contraindications, only a few patients with AIS are eligible candidates. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have the potential to reduce brain damage from AIS. They can effectively repair endothelial cells with vascular injuries by directly differentiating into endothelial cells or releasing corresponding regulatory factors, which is a potentially important means for the prevention and treatment of a series of vascular system disorders. The introduction of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technology provides a highly feasible option for clinical application of EPCs. Allogeneic iPSC-EPCs can be produced on a large scale to provide enough cells, fundamentally solving the problem of insufficient dosage, and making them a feasible clinical option for treatment of AIS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","EPCs"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":27,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment (clinical standard treatment, iEPCs)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive clinical standard treatment and iEPCs IV with a single dose","interventionNames":["Drug: iEPCs","Combination Product: Clinical standard treatment (CST)"]},{"label":"Placebo (clinical standard treatment, Placebo)","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients receive clinical standard treatment and placebo IV 150 mL with a single dose","interventionNames":["Combination Product: Clinical standard treatment (CST)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"iEPCs","description":"Given: IV","armGroupLabels":["Treatment (clinical standard treatment, iEPCs)"],"otherNames":["iPSC EPCs"]},{"type":"COMBINATION_PRODUCT","name":"Clinical standard treatment (CST)","description":"Clinical standard treatment","armGroupLabels":["Placebo (clinical standard treatment, Placebo)","Treatment (clinical standard treatment, iEPCs)"],"otherNames":["CST"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Evaluate the Incidence and severity of adverse events after iEPCs infusion","description":"Incidence and severity of adverse events assessed by CTCAE V5.0 during the twelve-month study period after iEPCs infusion.","timeFrame":"baseline to 1 year"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"HLA matching","description":"the level of HLA matching pairs of donor/recipient","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"plasma HLA antibody","description":"The change from the baseline of plasma HLA antibody will be calculated at month 1, month 3, month 6, month 9, month 12 post infusion, as available.","timeFrame":"month 1, month 3, month 6, month 9, month 12"},{"measure":"plasma T lymphocytes","description":"The change from the baseline in plasma T lymphocytes will be calculated at month 1, month 3, month 6, month 9, month 12 post infusion, as available.","timeFrame":"month 1, month 3, month 6, month 9, month 12"},{"measure":"plasma iEPCs","description":"The change from the baseline in plasma iEPCs will be calculated at month 1, month 3 post infusion, as available.","timeFrame":"month 1, month 3"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale, mRS","description":"The change from the baseline in mRS will be calculated at month 1, month 3, month 6, as available.
