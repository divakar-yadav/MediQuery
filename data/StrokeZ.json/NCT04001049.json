The main objective is to evaluate the impact of glycemic variability (GV) on stroke outcome (mortality, functional recovery) of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Glycemic variability will be assessed using a subcutaneous device for continuous glycaemia motorization during 96 hours; also capillar glycaemia will be measured every 6 hours.","detailedDescription":"10 different hospitals in Spain will participate in this study, recruiting a total of 340 patients. Once the informed consent form is signed, the subcutaneous device for continuous glycaemia motorization will be implanted and demographic, comorbidities and treatments of every patient will be registered. During the first 96 hours, capillar glycaemia, NIHSS scale, HbA1C levels, cerebral recanalization treatment and glycaemia correcting treatments will also be reported. In the following days (7, 30 and 90 days after stroke) modified Rankin Scale, NIHSS scale and stroke secondary prevention treatments will be evaluated. At day 90, a new measure of HbA1C will be done."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Ischemia","Hyperglycemia","Glycemic Variability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"NONE_RETAINED","description":"Blood samples"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":340,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Glycemic variation impact in mortality of patients with acute ischemic stroke","description":"Intrahospital mortality","timeFrame":"3 months from stroke"},{"measure":"Glycemic variation impact in functional status of patients with acute ischemic stroke","description":"Modified Rankin Scale.
