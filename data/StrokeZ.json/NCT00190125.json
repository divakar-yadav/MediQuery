In addition to diabetes and hypertension, malnutrition and chronic inflammation are well-known to be major risk factors of cardiovascular diseases in normal population. For detecting the malnutrition and chronic inflammation and understanding the exact influences to hemodialysis patients, we conduct this study. We will collect the biochemical parameters, inflammatory markers, lipid parameters, hematologic parameters, and genomic DNA of patients. Then we will prospectively record the hospitalization, cardiovascular events, complications of arteriovenous fistula/graft, and mortality. According to the above results, we try to explore the exact role of malnutrition and inflammation in hemodialysis patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemodialysis","Malnutrition","Inflammation","Myocardial Ischemia","Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Hemodialysis","Malnutrition","Inflammation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have received hemodialysis therapy for more than three months\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Having active infection diseases now\n* Patients who have a malignancy\n* Had cardiovascular events in recent three months","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Yu-Sen Peng, M.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"886-2-89667000","phoneExt":"1514","email":"taan70@yahoo.com.tw"},{"name":"Chih-Kang Chiang, M.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"886-2-23123456","phoneExt":"3923","email":"ckchiang@mail.femh.org.tw"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Yu-Sen Peng, M.D.","affiliation":"Far Eastern Memorial Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Far Eastern Memorial Hospital","city":"Pan-Chiao, Taipei country","zip":"220","country":"Taiwan","contacts":[{"name":"Yu-Sen Peng, M.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"886-89667000","phoneExt":"1514","email":"taan70@yahoo.com.tw"},{"name":"Chih-Kang Chiang, M.D.","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"}]}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"14582032","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Kalantar-Zadeh K, Ikizler TA, Block G, Avram MM, Kopple JD.
