The evaluation of certain domains may be more difficult so, specific assessment tools are necessary to analyze them.","detailedDescription":"The presence of a damage to the central and / or peripheral nervous system resulting from diseases of a different nature (such as, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, dementia, head trauma, stroke, epilepsy or other neurological syndromes) is commonly cause of both physical than mental disability. The presence of cognitive deficits in the sphere of memory or language is often evident at a first clinical examination. However, the evaluation of certain domains such as mood disorders, behavior, sleep-wake cycle or eating habits, may be less evident, even if they have a very strong impact on the quality of life of patients. Specific assessment tools are therefore needed such as psychometric tests, to collect information and analyze the results.\n\nThe main evaluation scales we will use are the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI II), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), The twenty-item Toronto Alexithymia scale- I (TAS-20), The fatigue severity scale (FSS), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), The Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQ1), The Multiple Sclerosis quality of life Inventory (MSQOLI), The work productivity and activity impairment instrument (WPAI), Frailty Index.\n\nThese rating scales will be administered in person, by telephone and / or by sending them electronically."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Multiple Sclerosis","Epilepsy","Parkinson Disease","Dementia","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Psychometric Evaluations","description":"The main evaluation scales we will use are the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI II), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), The twenty-item Toronto Alexithymia scale- I (TAS-20), The fatigue severity scale (FSS), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), The Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) (Johns MW. 1991), The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQ1), The Multiple Sclerosis quality of life Inventory (MSQOLI), The work productivity and activity impairment instrument (WPAI), Frailty Index.\n\nThese rating scales will be administered in person, by telephone and / or by sending them electronically."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"500 patients will be enrolled in the study.
