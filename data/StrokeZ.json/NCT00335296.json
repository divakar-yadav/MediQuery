An association between patent foramen ovale and severe migraine headaches has also been reported. Several implantable devices are being used for percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale; this study uses a non-implantable system to safely effect closure with the application of radiofrequency energy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Patent Foramen Ovale"],"keywords":["PFO","Migraine","Stroke","TIA (transient ischemic attack)","Decompression
