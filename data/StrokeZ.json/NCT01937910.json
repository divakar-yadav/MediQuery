Further, the investigators will determine which is the key driver of recovery of arm function after stroke: changes in the structure of the brain or changes in how brain regions interact with one another. Together, these data will advance the investigators understanding of how neural systems support recovery from stroke. The investigators will use a MRI technique that allows us to assess the health of a brain structure called myelin. This structure is important as it allows information to travel down nerves faster; the more myelin the quicker the signal can be conducted. The investigators aim is to test whether or not movement training can restore myelin in the brain. If movement training does restore myelin in the brain, the investigators will have identified an important new target for rehabilitation interventions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["neuroplastic change","myelin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":88,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the stroke group will complete 10 training sessions of the TRAIT task.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: TRAIT Task"]},{"label":"Matched Healthy Control Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants in the Matched Healthy Control group will complete 10 sessions of the TRAIT task","interventionNames":["Behavioral: TRAIT Task"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"TRAIT Task","description":"Increased paretic arm will be manipulated through the performance of a semi-immersive virtual reality-based intercept and release task called TRAIT (TRack And Intercept Task), which is performed in an interactive environment. TRAIT employs an open source Kinect sensor, which tracks 3-D joint movement. Participants are asked to control an on-screen icon using movements of their paretic arm to intercept a moving object as it emerges from the side of a computer screen. Once intercepted, they must accurately throw the object to hit a target. Participants move up through 10 levels of the game as their skill improves. Participants will complete 10 TRAIT training sessions in 4 weeks for a total of 10,000 experimental movements.","armGroupLabels":["Matched Healthy Control Group","Stroke Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Myelin water fraction","description":"Myelin water fraction (MWF) is the area of the short T2 component (15-35ms) divided by the total T2 distribution expressed as a percentage (MWF% = MWF\\*100)","timeFrame":"Baseline and 30 days post baseline"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Fractional anisotropy","description":"Diffusion properties will be defined by calculating a 6-element tensor ellipsoid to provide both the magnitude and direction of diffusivity in a local orthogonal coordinate system within each voxel.
