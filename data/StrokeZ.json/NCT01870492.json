Several studies, including the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry (PCNASR), have reported low rates of adherence to stroke care guidelines, suggesting that many AIS patients do not receive proper treatment according to established guidelines. Thus, there remains an increasing need to assess and address the barriers that prevent patient access to proper AIS treatment.\n\nAnnually, approximately 20,000 patients are discharged from Wisconsin hospitals with the diagnosis of stroke and an estimated 4,000 patients die from stroke each year in WI. To date, there have been no statewide studies initiated in Wisconsin to assess the regional barriers to the treatment of AIS patients with thrombolytic or endovascular therapy, and many hospitals do not routinely collect and analyze AIS patient data.\n\nThe goal of the Improving Patient Access to Stroke Therapy (IMPACT) pilot study is to engage community hospitals statewide to identify the regional barriers to AIS therapy in WI."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Transient Ischemic Attack"],"keywords":["IV-tPA","Activase","endovascular
