It affects people of all nationalities, creeds, and socioeconomic classes through a narrow array of mechanisms. With all those mechanisms, a common outcome is shared: derangement of the brain parenchymal architecture. This derangement is non-selective in its destruction with obscuration of the blood brain barrier and the glymphatic system, and with bleeding as a common sequela; the oxidative stress of the hemoglobin-heme-iron compound causing further injury. This study will measure Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a well-documented inflammatory biomarker that is increased in the acute phase of stroke, and to compare its levels after the administration of melatonin - a well-documented anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant - that regulates circadian rhythm, which helps promote sleep. Any increased time spent in a restful state because of melatonin increases the clearance of waste products after a catastrophic event, like in stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Patients will receive 3mg of melatonin or no melatonin for up to seven days or for the duration of his or hospital stay for a maximum total of 21mg of melatonin.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"At discharge, the patient will be assessed via a blinded-physician for NIHSS and this value will be recorded.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Melatonin Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive 3mg of melatonin at 18:00 (+/- one hour) each evening up to seven days or for the duration of his or her hospital stay.","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Melatonin"]},{"label":"No Melatonin Group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Participants will receive no melatonin for the length of their hospital stay."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"Melatonin","description":"Participants in the Melatonin Group will receive 3mg of melatonin each evening for up to seven days for a maximum total of 21mg of melatonin.","armGroupLabels":["Melatonin Group"],"otherNames":["Nature Made melatonin","N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in serum Interleukin 6 (IL 6)","description":"Determine whether Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is lowered after the administration of melatonin.
