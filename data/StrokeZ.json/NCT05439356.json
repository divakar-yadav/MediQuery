Patients who were eligible to the inclusion criteria and ineligible to the exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned into two groups by a 1:1 ratio. Patients in one arm will receive colchicine initiated with a dose of 1mg per day on days 1 through 3, and continuing with 0.5 mg per day on days 4 through 90, and those in the other arm will receive an equivalent placebo drug. Study visits will be performed on the day of randomization, at discharge, at day 90 and at 1 year. The primary outcome was stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) during 90 days of follow-up in an intention-to treat analysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic
