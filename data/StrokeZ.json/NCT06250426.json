One of these strategies is thickening products, which are used to reduce pharyngeal bolus velocity by increasing viscosity of fluids. There are several studies demonstrating the therapeutic effect of thickeners in reducing the prevalence of penetrations and aspirations, and their use has been correlated with reduced prevalence of respiratory infections, aspiration pneumonia and hospital readmissions.\n\nIn recent years, new neurorehabilitation treatment strategies for OD have been developed such as peripheral (electrical or chemical stimulation) or central stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation).\n\nThe investigators suggest that new generation treatments for OD have to combine thickened fluids and about peripheral stimulation using transient receptor potential (TRP) channels agonists. The aim of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of a cooling sensation (CS) flavor in a pre-thickened oral nutritional supplement (ONS) drink on the biomechanical mechanism of the swallow response in chronic post-stroke patients with OD.\n\nThe investigators designed a randomized, crossover, interventional and open-label clinical study. The study includes 2 groups: 1) n=25: 1st visit: stimulation with Control, 2nd visit: stimulation with CS; and 2) n=25: 1st visit: stimulation with CS, 2nd visit: stimulation with Control. Each patient will attend a total of 2 visits, with a washing period of at least 7 days between visits. The procedures to be performed during each visit are: clinical assessment of swallowing with V-VST, spontaneous swallowing frequency measurement using electromyography, and collection of a sample of saliva using a Salivette®."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Oropharyngeal Dysphagia","Stroke","Swallowing Disorder"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized, crossover, interventional and, open-label clinical study.
