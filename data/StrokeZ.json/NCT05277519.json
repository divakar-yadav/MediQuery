It is known that such a treatment promotes motor recovery after stroke assuming that it enhances neuroplasticity. The aim of the research is to study the activity in cerebrospinal circuitry to evaluate the neuroplastic changes during and after instrumented proprioceptive rehabilitation relying on sequences of muscle vibration in subacute stroke stages.","detailedDescription":"Randomized control trial : 28 patients with active vibrations vs. 28 patients with sham stimulation Subacute phase : D15 to 6 months after stroke or patients with traumatic brain injury with similar semiology as stroke (hemiparesis) Measure at baseline : Electrophysiological investigations (EMG,EEG, MRI, clinical evaluation) Treatment of 5 weeks with 3 sessions of vibrations or sham a week Evaluation at mid time (electrophysiology and clinical examinations) Final examination (electrophysiology, MRI and clinical examination)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis","Traumatic Brain Injury"],"keywords":["Neuroplasticity","Electrophysiology","MRI","Neurophysiology","Muscle
