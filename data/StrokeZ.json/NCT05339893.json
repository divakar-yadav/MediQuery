This practice will ensure understanding and serve to activate the hemisphere ipsilateral to the impaired limb. Patients are likely to perform this activity quickly, there will not be any taVNS during this part of the procedure. Patients will then wear the taVNS device on the left ear for the duration of the subsequent phase of the robotic training. During this phase the patient will engage the robotic device with the affected limb and complete the protocol and the stimulation or sham stimulation will occur with every extensor movement."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["taVNS","Trans Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation","Robotic Training","Upper Limb Motor Recovery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"To determine whether treatment with taVNS during the robotic training of a patient with stroke and a paralyzed arm will alter the motor impairment.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"The patient will not know whether they are receiving taVNS, all patients will feel a tingling in the ear as the current is ramped up and then down to determine a stimulation threshold, but only the active group will receive timed stimulation bursts during the robotic protocol that engages the affected limb.
