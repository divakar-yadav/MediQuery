Cost effectiveness: Evaluation of cost effectiveness of Solitaire and/or React Aspiration catheters family of devices will be performed without a statistical test. Therefore, there is no hypothesis test for this ancillary objective. Cost effectiveness will be calculated using a credible model with inputs from the PRAAN study wherever possible (e.g., age, mortality, quality of life). When direct input from the study is not possible, inputs will be derived from prior clinical evidence, from localized outcomes research (within region of from comparable region), or from expert advisory board input. A separate document will outline the plan for evaluating the cost-effectiveness component. Cost effectiveness will be expressed as incremental cost in local currency per quality adjusted life year gained (QALY).","timeFrame":"At subject discharge after the procedure and 3 month after the procedure"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
