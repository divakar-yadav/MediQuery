Participants will be divided into two cohorts depending on their transcranial doppler (TCD) ultrasound results and whether or not they receive hydroxyurea (medication that they may already be taking). In one cohort, participants with conditional transcranial doppler (TCD) or participants with abnormal TCD who are not able to receive hydroxyurea will be included. The study doctor will determine if the TCD result is conditional or abnormal. In another cohort, participants with conditional TCD or participants with abnormal TCD who are receiving a stable dose of hydroxyurea will be included. The study doctor will determine if the TCD result is conditional or abnormal. The participant will start a 52-week (1 year) treatment period. The participant will take 400 milligrams (mg) of etavopivat once a day for the 52 weeks. The dose of 400 mg will be taken as 2 tablets by mouth, each containing 200 mg of etavopivat. Etavopivat may be taken with or without food. Each dose should be taken with a glass of water. As part of the study, the participants will be asked to visit the clinic frequently. At the end of the study, if deemed appropriate by you, your child, and the study doctor, your child may be offered the opportunity to participate in a separate study to continue receiving etavopivat."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sickle Cell Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":46,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Etavopivat","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive Etavopivat 400 mg once daily (QD) orally.","interventionNames":["Drug: Etavopivat","Drug: Hydroxyurea"]},{"label":"Etavopivat with HU","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive Etavopivat 400 mg QD orally in combination with HU.

Confirmed diagnosis of SCD\n\n   • Documentation of SCD genotype (HbSS, HbSβ0 -thalassemia) based on prior history of laboratory testing. Molecular genotyping is not required. SCD genotype may be determined from the results of Hb electrophoresis, high-performance liquid chromatography, or similar testing.\n4.

Hb ≥ 6 grams per deciliter (g/dL) and lesser than or equal to (≤) 9 g/dL at screening\n6. For participants with aTCD and cTCD and already taking HU, the dose of HU milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) must be stable (no more than a 20% change in dosing except for weight-based changes) for at least 90 days prior to start of study treatment with no anticipated need for dose adjustments except for weight-based changes during the study, in the opinion of the Investigator.\n\n   Sex and Contraceptive Requirements\n7. Patients, who if female and of childbearing potential, are using acceptable methods of contraception and agree not to donate ova from study start to 90 days after the last dose of study drug, and who if male, are willing to use acceptable methods of contraception and agree not to donate sperm, from study start to 90 days after the last dose of study drug.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nMedical Conditions\n\n1. Female who is breast feeding or pregnant\n2. History of seizure disorder\n3.
