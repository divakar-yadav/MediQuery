The study is designed to evaluate rivaroxaban in the prevention of symptomatic VTE events and VTE-related deaths for a period of 45 days post-hospital discharge. The study will consist of a screening phase, a 45-day double-blind treatment phase, and a 30-day follow-up phase. Study drug will start at randomization (Day 1), and will continue until Day 45 (inclusive). A total of approximately 12000 patients will be randomly assigned to either rivaroxaban or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The total duration for a patient who completes the study after randomization is expected to be 75 days."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Heart Failure","Respiratory Insufficiency","Stroke Acute","Infectious Diseases","Rheumatic Diseases"],"keywords":["Heart Failure","Respiratory Insufficiency","Stroke Acute","Infectious Diseases","Rheumatic Diseases","Medically ill Patient","Rivaroxaban","Thromboembolism","Prophylactic Anti-Coagulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12024,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Rivaroxaban","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Each patient will receive either 10 mg or 7.5 mg rivaroxaban tablet once daily orally (by mouth) for 45 days.
