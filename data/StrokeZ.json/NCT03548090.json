The first phase is performed in a cross-over fashion. Participants will stand on two different incline angles on the paretic LE and simultaneously move a small skateboard forward with the non-paretic LE. The testing order for the two different incline angles will be randomized, and all participants will be required to complete both incline angle conditions within a single test session.\n\nThe second phase will also be performed in a cross-over fashion. Participants will stand with three different percentages of body weight on their paretic LE while moving the skateboard forward with the non-paretic LE. The testing order for the three body weight percentages will be randomized. All participants will be required to complete all three body weight conditions within a single test session.\n\nIn the third phase, participants will be randomized to either a control 4-week exercise intervention (conventional physical therapy) or a 4-week experimental exercise intervention (plantar flexion training). Both the control and exerimental arms will complete over-ground multi-directional gait training and home exercise."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiplegic Gait"],"keywords":["stroke

The participant will be fully secured to prevent compensatory behaviors from trunk or hips that may influence results. A pre-speed warm up on the Biodex of three submaximal repetitions and one maximal repetition will be conducted prior to testing so the participant understands what these repetitions feel like.
