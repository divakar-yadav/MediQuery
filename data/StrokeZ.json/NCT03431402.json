Clinically, the narrow time window of thrombolytic therapy and coexisting contraindications limit the use of t-PA \\[2\\]. Thus, searching for an effective supplemental treatment for acute ischemic stroke is imperative.\n\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is valuable in treating acute carbon monoxide poisoning \\[3,4\\], air or gas embolism \\[5\\], facilitating wound healing \\[6\\] and has been used as an adjuvant treatment for many neurological disorders that need further study as concussion \\[7\\] , stroke \\[8,9\\], cerebral palsy \\[ 10\\],traumatic brain injury \\[ 11\\], cerebral air embolism \\[12\\], Autism \\[13\\] and multiple sclerosis \\[14\\].\n\nIndications of hyperbaric oxygen therapy recommended by undersea and hyperbaric medical society (UHMS) \\[15\\] are 1.air or gas embolism \\[5\\], 2.carbon monoxide poisoning \\[3,4\\], 3.clostridial myositis and myonecrosis \\[16\\], 4.crush injury, compartment syndrome and other acute traumatic ischemias \\[17\\], 5.decompression sickness \\[18\\], 6.arterial insufficiencies \\[19\\], 7.severe anemia \\[20\\], 8.intracranial abscess \\[21\\], 9.necrotizing soft tissue infections \\[22\\],10. refractory osteomyelitis \\[23\\], 11.delayed radiation injury \\[24\\], 12.compromised grafts and flaps \\[25\\], 13.acute thermal burn injury \\[26\\] and 14.idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss \\[27\\].\n\nKnown mechanisms of HBOT-induced neuroprotection include enhancing neuronal viability via increased tissue oxygen delivery to the area of diminished blood flow, reducing brain edema, and improving metabolism after ischemia \\[28,29\\]. Furthermore, a recent study performed on a rat suggested that upregulation of the expression of glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) might underlie the effect of HBOT \\[30\\].\n\nThe effectiveness of use of Hyperbaric oxygen therapy in human ischemic stroke is still controversial that need further evaluation.","detailedDescription":"Study Methods:\n\nStudy Population A 60 adult (aged \\>18 years) patients were included with a diagnosis of acute thromboembolic ischemic stroke within 48 hours after onset, according to clinical picture and imaging findings by brain computed tomography (CT) without evidence of hemorrhage, upon admission to the hospital and no patient received thrombolytic therapy.\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nGroup one, HBOT group (n = 30): thirty adult patients with acute ischemic stroke will receive conventional medical treatment ( as antiplatelet but not thrombolytic therapy) with 10 sessions of adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) within 3-5 days after the onset of stroke .\n\nCompared with Group two, control group(n = 30): thirty adult patients with acute ischemic stroke will receive conventional medical treatment alone.\n\nThe baseline clinical characteristics were similar in both groups.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Patient with cerebral hemorrhage\n* Patient received thrombolytic therapy\n* Emphysema with carbon dioxide retention\n* Pneumothorax\n* Seizure disorder\n* Uncontrolled high fever\n\nDemographic Characteristics:\n\nAdults more than 18 years, Any gender.
