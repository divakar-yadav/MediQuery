The secondary outcomes included mRS score on day 90, the proportion of subjects with mRS score ≤2 on day 90, the change of NIHSS score from baseline to day 14 and the proportion of subjects with NIHSS score ≤1 on day 14, 30, 90 after treatment. Safety outcomes included adverse events, treatment related adverse events within day 90, and changes in vital signs and laboratory data before and after treatment.\n\nSubjects in the Sequential group receive Edaravone Dexborneol concentrated solution for injections 37.5 mg BID administered intravenously for 5 - 10 days, and then followed by Edaravone Dexborneol Sublingual Tablets 30 mg BID administered sublingually for the last days, the total duration of treatment was 14 days.
