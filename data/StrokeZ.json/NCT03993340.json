Specifically, modern endovascular thrombectomy using a stent retriever, contact aspiration thrombectomy, or both are allowed. The number of thrombectomy attempts is at the operator's discretion. After failure of standard thrombectomy procedure, rescue stenting with Solitaire will be done. Additional balloon angioplasty, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (GPI), or thrombolytic infusions are optional and at the operator's discretion. After successful recanalization with rescue stenting, intravenous maintenance of GPI at least for a 12 hours and then changed to oral antiplatelet are recommended.","armGroupLabels":["1"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"modified Rankin scale","description":"The rate of good functional outcome defined by modified Rankin Scale score, 0 - 2","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Patency of the target artery","description":"The rate of patency of the treated artery at follow-up vascular imaging (magnetic resonance angiography, computed tomography angiography, or catheter angiography)","timeFrame":"1 day to 28 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 1.
