Physical activity in stroke patients has never previously been measured immediately after debut of symptoms; furthermore there is no knowledge about the optimal dose of physical rehabilitation for these patients.\n\nAccelerometers, small measuring devices, are a relatively new way to measure physical activity precisely, and hence it is possible to obtain an objective measure of how active stroke patients are in the first week after admission. The accelerometers measure a variable voltage, depending on the range and intensity of movement. They can measure movement dependent of the placement of the accelerometer, for instance over the hip, arm or leg. Studies confirm their reliability, even in patients with abnormal gait, such as stroke patients.\n\nAnother approach of studying the effects of physical activity and rehabilitation is through the examination of biomarkers. Studies have shown that biomarkers released during physical activity can inhibit biomarkers released after tissue injury in the brain, as seen after stroke. These brain biomarkers cause further damage and studies show that the higher the levels, the higher the damage. It is therefore obvious to examine whether physical activity rehabilitation can down regulate this destructive process in patients with stroke.\n\nClarification of the optimal dose of physical activity in stroke patients immediately after debut of symptoms and examination of both the biochemical aspects of physical rehabilitation as well as the optimal dose of physical rehabilitation is of great importance for many patients, their relatives as well as of a great socioeconomic importance.\n\nThe purpose of the project is to investigate feasibility of treadmill training on a weight-bearing treadmill in the acute phase after admission after an ischemic stroke. Furthermore we wish to investigate the acute inflammatory response after ischemic stroke and whether it changes with treadmill training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Physical Activity","Accelerometer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High dose training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"2 x 30 minutes/day on a weight-bearing treadmill","interventionNames":["Behavioral: physical activity, 2 x 30 minutes/day"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"physical activity, 2 x 30 minutes/day","description":"weight-bearing treadmill, pulse reserve increase of 50%","armGroupLabels":["High dose training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Level of inflammation, under, during and after treadmill training","description":"Biomarker concentration: Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, Tumor Necrosis Factor(TNF)-alpha, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), IL-1ra, IL-10, fasting-insulin, fasting-glucose","timeFrame":"up to 5 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Correlation of biomarker level","description":"Correlation with time, activity counts on an accelerometer, Scandinavian Stroke Scale Score (SSS), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (NIHSS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Barthels Index-100 (BI), 10 Meters Walking Test (10MWT), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS), Bergs Balance test, age, Body Mass Index and sex","timeFrame":"up to 5 days"},{"measure":"Feasibility","description":"Whether it is feasible/possible to train patients on a treadmill in the acute phase after ischemic stroke;
