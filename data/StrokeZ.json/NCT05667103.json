All enrolled patients will be followed up at 90 days after randomization.","detailedDescription":"AIS due to large vessel occlusion (LVO) remains a substantial cause of mortality and morbidity. Recent guidelines have recommended MT as the first-line therapy for AIS-LVO in the anterior circulation. Thrombectomy using a stent retriever is safe and effective in the treatment of AIS. As a new generation of stent retriever, Embotrap stent retriever has a unique design including an open outer cage for clot capture and a closed inner channel for clot stabilization. Previous studies showed Embotrap stent retriever can achieve a successful recanalization of 88% and favorable outcome of 51%. Also, the Multicenter ARISE II Study showed the first-pass effect of EmboTrap stent retriever was 40.1%, higher than other stent retrievers, such as Solitaire FR and Trevo device. But most studies were single-armed without direct comparison. Thus, this prospective cohort study is designed to compare the safety and efficacy of Embotrap stent retriever with other stent retrievers without inner channel."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Embotrap","Acute ischemic stroke","Mechanical thrombectomy","Stent retriever"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This study is a multicenter, parallel cohort study. The patients with acute middle cerebral artery occlusion were divided into Embotrap group and control group at a ratio of 1:1 to receive mechanical thrombectomy. The patients in control group will receive thrombectomy using stent retriever without inner channel approved by FDA or NMPA. Several aspects such as first-pass recanalization rate, the successful recanalization rate, and mRS score at 90 days will be compared between the two groups.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":330,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Embotrap stent retriever","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Embotrap stent retriever"]},{"label":"Other stent retriever without endochannel","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Solitaire FR, Trevo stent retriever without inner channel"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Embotrap stent retriever","description":"Embotrap has a novel design of an open outer cage for clot capture and a closed inner channel for clot stabilization, with great thrombus fixation and anti-escape ability, to improve the successful recanalization rate and good prognosis of patients.","armGroupLabels":["Embotrap stent retriever"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Solitaire FR, Trevo stent retriever without inner channel","description":"Other stent retriever without inner channel, such as Solitaire FR, Trevo, and other stent retrievers approved by FDA or NMPA.","armGroupLabels":["Other stent retriever without endochannel"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"First-pass complete recanalization rate","description":"FPE, eTICI≥2c","timeFrame":"intraoperative (After first-pass thrombectomy)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"First-pass successful recanalization rate","description":"mFPE, eTICI≥2b50","timeFrame":"intraoperative (After first-pass thrombectomy)"},{"measure":"Final successful recanalization rate","description":"mFPE, eTICI≥2b50","timeFrame":"intraoperative (Final Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) during operation)"},{"measure":"Final complete recanalization rate","description":"FPE, eTICI≥2c","timeFrame":"intraoperative (Final Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) during operation)"},{"measure":"90-day favorable outcome rate","description":"Modified Rankin scale (mRS), the scale runs from 0 to 6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death. 90-day favorable outcome is identified as mRS 0-2.","timeFrame":"90-days (±14days)"},{"measure":"The improvement of the NIHSS scores 24 hours after surgery","description":"National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)","timeFrame":"24 hours after surgery"},{"measure":"The improvement of the NIHSS scores 5-7 days after surgery or at discharge","description":"National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)","timeFrame":"5-7 days after surgery or at discharge, whichever came first"},{"measure":"The rescue therapy rate","description":"The rate of rescue therapy, such as balloon dilation, stent implantation, and intra-arterial thrombolysis.","timeFrame":"During procedure time"},{"measure":"FFR after 5 minutes of mechanical thrombectomy","description":"Fractional flow reserve (FFR)","timeFrame":"5 minutes after successful vessel recanalization."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
