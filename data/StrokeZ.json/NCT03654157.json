According to the official Russian statistics, in 2015, CVD was the cause in 34% of deaths in Russia2.\n\nAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is the most prevalent manifestation of CVD and is associated with high mortality and morbidity. No other life-threatening disease is as prevalent or expensive to society3. In 2014 in Russian Federation 46 250 people died from acute myocardial infarction (MI) and 17 605 people died from recurrent MI4.\n\nACS is a clinical syndrome characterized by unstable angina (UA), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The most common cause of ACS is reduced myocardial perfusion that results from coronary artery narrowing caused by the formation of partially or totally occlusive thrombi in response to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques on the vessel wall5-7.\n\nIn Russian Federation ACS management after ACS is provided in out-patient settings by doctors of different specialties (cardiologists and general practitioners (GPs)). However, the management of ACS in out-patient settings in some regions in Russian Federation is frequently suboptimal. Moscow city significantly differs from other parts of Russia from ACS management at hospital stage (up to 90% of PCI managed ST elevation myocardial infarction (MI) patients, no thrombolysis, short first medical contact to balloon time etc.) but it is unclear if management of post MI patients in Moscow out-patient settings is also optimal. In-hospital mortality in MI patients decreased last years but there is no data on clinical outcomes during 12 months after MI in Moscow.\n\nThis study will provide the epidemiological data about rates of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) (MI, stroke, cardiovascular death) within 12 months after MI in real clinical practice in Moscow and describe DAPT at out-patient setting. The information received in this study will help to optimize management of Russian patients with ACS. The data will be used in discussion with payers"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Heart Attack","Stroke","Cardiovascular Death"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1576,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"the cumulative incidence of Major Adverse Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Events (MACСE)","description":"The primary objective of this study is to describe the cumulative incidence of Major Adverse Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Events (MACСE) \\[MI, stroke, and cardiovascular death\\] observed over 1 year after index MI in all patients enrolled in the study.","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nThe subject population that will be observed in this prospective study must meet the following criteria:\n\n1.
