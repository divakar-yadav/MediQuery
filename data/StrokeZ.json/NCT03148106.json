The ultimate goal is to some day design an effective long-term training program to help someone recovery their ability to use their hands and function independently at home and in society. In order to know how to apply electrical nerve stimulation to produce a good long-term effect on hand dysfunction, we first need to know how to make it work best in the short-term, and improve our understanding of for whom it works and how it works.We will use a commercially available transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit to gently apply electrical nerve stimulation over the skin of the affected arm. This is a portable, safe and easy to use device designed for patients to operate in their homes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Upper Extremity Paresis","Disability Physical","Chronic Stroke","Motor Disorders"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Somatosensory Electrical Stimulation","description":"We will put adhesive electrodes on the affected arm and connect it to a device that will deliver a gentle electrical stimulation to the hand and arm. The stimulation will last for different amounts of time, depending on the stimulation condition. This can be 30 minutes twice a day (1 hour apart), 1 hour continuously, 2 hours continuously, or 3 hours continuously. The stimulation conditions will also vary in stimulation strength. It is normal that some people may feel a tingling sensation, while others may feel nothing.","otherNames":["transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Finger Fractionation","description":"Ability to fractionate movement can be assessed by asking the patient to move one segment in isolation and keep other, adjacent segments still.","timeFrame":"Baseline and immediately post-stimulation"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Modified Ashworth Scale","description":"standard instrument","timeFrame":"Baseline and immediately post-stimulation"},{"measure":"Change in Arm Research Action Test","description":"standard instrument","timeFrame":"Baseline and immediately post-stimulation"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age 18-80 years, has residual hand motor dysfunction caused by a single ischemic and/or hemorrhagic stroke greater than 6 months prior to enrollment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnant; uncontrolled medical problems including but not limited to severe cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary disease; active cancer; significant hand joint deformity or other diagnosis with major effect on hand function besides stroke; severe alcohol or drug abuse within the past year; untreated or inadequately treated major depression; spasticity score \\>3 on the MAS; lack of finger range of motion of at least 10 degrees; severe aphasia or other communicative, behavioral or cognitive impairment that significantly interferes with the participant's ability to comply with the protocol or provide informed consent.
