Furthermore, muscle activity and kinematic movement patterns will be expected to show more involved muscle groups and a walking pattern involving more degrees of freedom during use of the new version compared with the established Lokomat.\n\nExploratory endpoints will be a significantly stronger involvement of muscles needed for balance, more physiological walking patterns and more change on the lateral positioning of the feet due to training with the new version, compared with the established Lokomat."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post Stroke Gait Training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":9,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Lokomat Pro","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"gait robot established on the market","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Gait training with Lokomat Pro"]},{"label":"Lokomat Pro FreeD","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"gait robot based on the Lokomat Pro with changes in guidance of the hip, approved for the Swiss market","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Gait training with Lokomat Pro FreeD"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Gait training with Lokomat Pro","armGroupLabels":["Lokomat Pro"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Gait training with Lokomat Pro FreeD","armGroupLabels":["Lokomat Pro FreeD"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Lateral hip movement","description":"during 30 min training with each device, lateral hip movements will be assessed","timeFrame":"30 min training during day 1 (next session after inclusion)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Patient satisfaction","description":"Satisfaction, based on questionnaires, will be assessed after training with the experimental and the standard device in two consecutive sessions (randomized order).","timeFrame":"day 2 and 3"},{"measure":"Patient motivation","description":"Patient motivation, based on questionnaires, will be assessed after training with the experimental and the standard device in two consecutive sessions (randomized order).","timeFrame":"day 2 and 3"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Lower extremity weakness due to stroke\n* minor functional impairment (MRC \\< 5)\n* ability and willingness to participate\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* severe spasticity of the lower extremities\n* severe dementia\n* severe depression\n* any other contraindications against Lokomat training\n* body weight \\> 135 kg","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Cereneo, Center For Rehabilitation and Neurology","city":"Vitznau","state":"LU","zip":"6354","country":"Switzerland","geoPoint":{"lat":47.01014,"lon":8.4842}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
