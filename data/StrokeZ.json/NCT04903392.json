Post-stroke muscle weakness has been shown to occur not only in the lower and upper extremity muscles but also in the respiratory muscles. It was found that the plantar pressure distribution in the affected side feet was decreased in individuals with stroke and this situation negatively affected the walking function. A systematic review of treadmill training revealed that treadmill training significantly increased walking speed and walking distance. Learning to walk backwards is also recommended to improve the movement components required for walking forward. As a result of the investigations, although there are studies about the effects of back-walking training on walking and balance function in chronic stroke patients, there is no study investigating the effects on plantar pressure distribution and respiratory parameters. Therefore, this study, which planned to investigate the effects of treadmill retching training on balance, plantar pressure distribution and respiratory parameters in chronic stroke patients, will contribute to the literature."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke Patients"],"keywords":["Chronic Stroke Patients","Balance","Plantar Pressure Distribution","Respiratory Parameters","Backward Gait Training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":28,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Backward Walking Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Conventional therapy + Backward Walking Training","interventionNames":["Other: Backward Walking Training"]},{"label":"Forward Walking Group","type":"OTHER","description":"Conventional therapy + Forward Walking Training","interventionNames":["Other: Forward Walking Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Backward Walking Training","description":"The training speed will start at the basic walking speed and will increase by 5% of the starting speed each week.
