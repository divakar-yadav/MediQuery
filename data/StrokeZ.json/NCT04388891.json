We aim to investigate the feasibility of minimally supervised therapy with the ReHapticKnob with stroke patients in a rehabilitation clinic, evaluate the usability of the ReHapticKnob (user interface and implemented exercises which were adapted for independent usage), and quantify the dose of additional robotic therapy that patients perform in a minimally supervised setting.\n\nMinimally supervised therapy means that after a training phase, where the therapists teach to the patients how to perform the exercises with the robot, the patients can autonomously train with the robot during free time without being directly supervised. Our hypothesis is that minimally supervised therapy might be a possible way to increase therapy dose for stroke patients, with the potential to further improve recovery of hand function with minimal additional burden for therapists and for the healthcare system."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Hand impairment","Robot-assisted therapy","Minimally supervised therapy","Neurorehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":23,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Minimally supervised therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will undergo minimally supervised therapy with the robot ReHapticKnob.","interventionNames":["Device: Minimally supervised therapy with the ReHapticKnob"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Minimally supervised therapy with the ReHapticKnob","description":"The therapy with the ReHapticKnob is performed in the clinic in addition to the conventional therapy.

During each session, the robot proposes a set of 3 exercises, each lasting between 10 and 15 minutes. During the minimally supervised phase (third and fourth week), the duration of the ReHapticKnob therapy is not specified, since the patient can decide by him/herself when to use the device, e.g. during freetime or during the weekend.","armGroupLabels":["Minimally supervised therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Compliance as assessed by dose","description":"Sum of the dose of robot-assisted therapy without direct supervision that the patient performs.","timeFrame":"Compliance to minimally supervised therapy is calculated at the end of the fourth week of the study protocol."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Usability as assessed by the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire","description":"Usability of the ReHapticKnob measured with the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (version 3).
