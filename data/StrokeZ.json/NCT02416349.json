In the first day, the participants will undergo to the initial assessment, which consisted of anamnesis and anthropometric measurements: weight, height and body mass index (BMI). Then, they will be submitting to spirometry and respiratory muscle pressure using a manovacuometer.\n\nAll patients will submit underwent two types of intervention: respiratory muscles stretching (RMS) and remain at rest (control group). The stretching will occur throughout the expiratory phase to allow respiratory muscles to reach their maximal length, and two sets with 10 consecutive incursions will use for each stretching pattern with an interval of 30 seconds between series.\n\nFor the intervention in the control group, all volunteers will be position at rest in a comfortable in a chair during 20 minutes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Stretching","Respiratory muscle","Ventilatory pattern","Optoelectronic plethysmography"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Respiratory Muscles Stretching","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Respiratory Muscles Stretching Neck stretching, upper chest stretching, pectoralis major stretching and lateral chest stretching.","interventionNames":["Other: Respiratory Muscles Stretching"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"All volunteers will be positioned at rest in a comfortable in a chair during 20 minutes.","interventionNames":["Other: Control Group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Respiratory Muscles Stretching","description":"Respiratory Muscles Stretching The stretching will occur throughout the expiratory phase to allow respiratory muscles to reach their maximal length, and two sets with 10 consecutive incursions will be use for each stretching pattern with an interval of 30 seconds between series.\n\nPattern 1: Neck stretching Pattern 2: Upper chest stretching Pattern 3:Pectoralis major stretching Pattern 4:Lateral chest stretching","armGroupLabels":["Respiratory Muscles Stretching"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control Group","description":"Control Group - all volunteers will be positioned at rest in a comfortable in a chair during 20 minutes.","armGroupLabels":["Control Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Chest Wall Volume","description":"Vcw -Total chest wall volume by Optoelectronic Plethysmography.","timeFrame":"During assessment and intervention, on average for an hour"},{"measure":"Compartmental chest wall volumes (composite)","description":"Vrcp - rib cage pulmonary volume; Vrca - rib cage abdominal volume; Vab - abdominal volume by Optoelectronic Plethysmography.","timeFrame":"During assessment and intervention, on average for an hour"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Ventilatory Pattern (Composite)","description":"Total time (Ttot), inspiratory time (Tinsp), expiratory time (Texp), Tinsp/Ttot index, breathing rate (BR), minute volume (VE), mean inspiratory flow (MIF) and mean expiratory flow (MEF)","timeFrame":"During assessment and intervention, on average for an hour"},{"measure":"Lung Capacity (Composite)","description":"VC - Vital capacity; Inspiratory Capacity by Optoelectronic Plethysmography.","timeFrame":"During assessment and intervention, on average for an hour"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients post-stroke with right hemiparesis no more than 3 months, from both sexes, aged above 20 years, score between 1 and 3 according to Ashworth Scale for upper limbs, score above 85 according to Barthel Index and a minimum punctuation of 18 for Mini Mental State Examination.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Volunteers presenting facial paralysis; rheumatic or orthopedic diseases; spinal abnormalities or deformities that compromise the respiratory mechanics; spirometry with forced expired volume in the first second (FEV1) bellow 80% from predicted values and FEV1∕forced vital capacity (FVC) ≤ .7; presenting respiratory comorbidities; recent history of thoracic or abdominal surgery; hemodynamic instability or pregnancy.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Armele Andrade, PhD","affiliation":"Federal University of Pernambuco - Department of Physical Therapy","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco - Laboratório de Fisiologia e Fisioterapia Cardiopulmonar - Recife - Brasil","city":"Recife","state":"Pernambuco","zip":"50740 - 560","country":"Brazil","geoPoint":{"lat":-8.05389,"lon":-34.88111}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"29608976","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Rattes C, Campos SL, Morais C, Goncalves T, Sayao LB, Galindo-Filho VC, Parreira V, Aliverti A, Dornelas de Andrade A.
