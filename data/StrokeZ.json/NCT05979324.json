The study is comparative in nature, where a group of 100 patients will be included in this randomized study, divided equally into a study group and a control group. The purpose of the study is also to demonstrate that this non-invasive new rehabilitation technology based on the ABAStroke computer software supports the process of rehabilitation in the field of cognitive functions together with standard pharmacological therapy, including the possibility of using rehabilitation (as recommended by researchers and other doctors conducting rehabilitation of a patient after a stroke brain). ABAStroke can lead to improved cognitive functions (such as abstraction, short-term memory, visuospatial functions, executive functions, language, verbal fluency, allopsychic orientation, and attention) and is delivered via a mobile device app that can be used at home."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The intervention will take place over a maximum of 104 days, i.e. 15 weeks, a minimum of 13 weeks, i.e. 91 days.
