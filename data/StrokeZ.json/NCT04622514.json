Integrated care for atrial fibrillation patients using simple ABC pathway ('A' Avoid stroke; 'B' Better symptom management; 'C' Cardiovascular and Comorbidity optimization) is associated with a lower risk of adverse outcomes included all-cause death, composite outcome of stroke/major bleeding/cardiovascular death, and first hospitalization. In China, the prevalence of AF is high, but older people living in rural areas are more vulnerable due to low awareness and treatment gaps caused by various factors. China's rural healthcare system, which is primarily reliant on village doctors, falls short of providing optimal management for AF. To support village doctors in providing integrated care for AF, we have developed a digital health support platform. However, the role of this novel telemedicine-based integrated care for AF patients in rural China remains unclear.\n\nAIM OF THIS STUDY This cluster randomization study aims to compare the village-doctor led telemedicine integrated care versus usual care to improve outcome of older patients with atrial fibrillation in rural China.\n\nDESIGN The MIRACLE-AF China trial is a perspective, cluster randomization clinical trial performed in rural China. We aim to include a minimum of 1000 patients with AF aged 65 years or above from around more than 30 village clinics. Follow-up duration of this study is up to 3 years and all patients are followed up every 3 months by rural doctors. Village clinics will be randomized to either the intervention group (the village-doctor led telemedicine integrated care) or the control group (enhanced usual care)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Older","Stroke"],"keywords":["atrial fibrillation","integrated care","rural China","older","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Outcome assessment committee members will be blinded to the group assignment.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Village doctor-led telemedicine integrated care","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"To empower village doctors, a new technology-based model of AF care was established in the intervention group.
