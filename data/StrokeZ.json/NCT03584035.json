To improve balance and reduce fall efficacy, the participants in the study group will be trained by six weeks three progressive steps of sensorimotor integration exercises. Each exercise step will take 30 minutes of a practice session, three sessions per week. Conventional physiotherapy (passive and active exercises and lower extremities strengthening exercises) will be given to the control group. The changes in balance performance and fall efficacy will be measured and compared within and between groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["sensory motor integration exercise"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized Control Trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The outcome assessor will do all assessments (pre and post intervention) without group allocation.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":46,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sensory motor integration group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Sensory-motor integration exercises with 3 progressive steps, 30 minutes per sessions, 3 sessions per week for 6 weeks.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: sensory motor integration exercises"]},{"label":"Conventional group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Conventional exercises include simple passive and active exercises and lower extremities strengthening exercises for balance and ambulation.
