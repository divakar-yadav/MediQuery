Using selective CRP-apheresis, the investigators aim to reduce the secondary inflammatory tissue damage in the course of infarction maturation using infarction growth in MRI as the primary outcome as a surrogate.","detailedDescription":"C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase protein binding to phosphocholine, thereby marking damaged tissue. This in turn activates the complement system and the cellular immune system engaging the unspecific immune system in an inflammatory tissue-degrading reaction. Such a pattern is observed in ischemic stroke, and elevated CRP levels can be measured in stroke survivors' sera. Several observational studies reproduced higher CRP levels with negative outcome in stroke. In another vascular model disease, myocardial infarction, selective CRP apheresis reduced infarct size in humans. The investigators therefore designed this pilot study to explore the effects of selective CRP reduction in ischemic stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","CRP apheresis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Comparisons will be drawn from historic controls from previous observational stroke studies","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CRP apheresis","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"CRP apheresis by means of selective apheresis using the \"PentraSorb\"-CRP adsorber","interventionNames":["Device: CRP apheresis"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"CRP apheresis","description":"selective CRP apheresis by use of the \"PentraSorb\"-CRP","armGroupLabels":["CRP apheresis"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Infarct growth","description":"Infarct growth measured via DWI-FLAIR volume change","timeFrame":"5 ± 1 days after infarction"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Infarct growth","description":"Infarct growth measured via diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-FLAIR volume change","timeFrame":"90 ± 14 days after infarction"},{"measure":"Stroke Severity","description":"National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score - ranging from 0-42 - higher values represent a worse outcome","timeFrame":"5 ± 1 days after infarction"},{"measure":"Functional Outcome","description":"Modified ranking scale (mRS) score - ranging from 0-6 with higher scores signifying worse outcome no subscales","timeFrame":"90 ± 14 days after infarction"},{"measure":"Dependency","description":"Barthel Index (BI) - ranging from 0-100 with higher scores signifying better outcome;
