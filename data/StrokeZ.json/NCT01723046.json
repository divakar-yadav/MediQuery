The use of robot assisted therapy (RAT) might partly solve this problem. Rehabilitation progress highly depends on training intensity and training duration, favouring the use of RAT.\n\nIn this pilot study, the clinical effects of using a new upper arm RAT device for upper arm rehabilitation in patients with stroke is investigated. Myo-electrical signals will serve as input for the device, assisting the user in flexion and extension of the elbow. The device is coupled to a virtual environments, creating a stimulating therapy environment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Upper extremity","Rehabilitation","Robot assisted therapy","Robotics","Devices","Orthosis","clinical outcome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Training with the device","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Training with new upper limb robot assisted therapy device","interventionNames":["Device: Training with new upper limb robot assisted therapy device"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"The control group is treated with conventional therapy."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Training with new upper limb robot assisted therapy device","description":"During 8 weeks, 3 times a week, 1 hour therapy sessions with the device","armGroupLabels":["Training with the device"],"otherNames":["active orthosis","exoskeleton"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer test upper limb section","description":"Stroke specific, performance based impairment index.
