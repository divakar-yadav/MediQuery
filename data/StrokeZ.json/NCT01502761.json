This investigation will address the safety and feasibility of directed, intra-arterial Magnesium measurement and therapy, through endovascular access, in acute stroke patients. The proposal represents the first study to directly quantify levels of a systemically administered neuroprotectant in the region of cerebral ischemia. It also establishes a novel endovascular platform for direct delivery of neuroprotective agents to ischemic cerebral tissue distal to an occlusive thrombus. This research seeks to improve patient care by establishing a novel delivery mechanism for the rescue of threatened brain parenchyma that can be administered rapidly following acute stroke. If successful, this selective distribution will allow delivery to \"at risk\" tissue in a rapid manner. Salvage of viable, but threatened, penumbral tissue could afford stroke patients an increased probability of favorable long term outcome. The investigators hypothesize that endovascular, intra-arterial, Magnesium administration will deliver high concentration of this neuroprotective agent to otherwise inaccessible cerebral territories, while limiting systemic concentrations. The proposed investigation will evaluate the safety and feasibility of this novel treatment technique"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","Magnesium","endovascular"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Regional Intra-arterial Magnesium 0.75g","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Regional Intra-arterial magnesium only 0.75 mg Magnesium Sulfate (50% Total Dose): 5 patients","interventionNames":["Drug: Magnesium Sulfate"]},{"label":"Regional Intra-arterial magnesium 1.5g","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Regional Intra-arterial magnesium Sulfate Only 1.5g (100% TD): 5 patients","interventionNames":["Drug: Magnesium Sulfate"]},{"label":"Regional/ Distal (75/25%) Magnesium 1.5g","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Regional/ Distal intra-arterial magnesium (75% TD regional- 1.125g / 25% distal-0.375g): 5 patients","interventionNames":["Drug: Magnesium Sulfate"]},{"label":"Regional/ Distal (50/50%) Magnesium 1.5g","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Regional/ Distal intra-arterial magnesium (50% TD regional- 0.75g/ 50% distal-0.75g): 5 patients","interventionNames":["Drug: Magnesium Sulfate"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Magnesium Sulfate","description":"Intra-arterial","armGroupLabels":["Regional Intra-arterial Magnesium 0.75g","Regional Intra-arterial magnesium 1.5g","Regional/ Distal (50/50%) Magnesium 1.5g","Regional/ Distal (75/25%) Magnesium 1.5g"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Magnesium Concentration in Region of Cerebral Ischemia","description":"Peripheral Magnesium Levels, meq/L will be obtained through the femoral sheath at the beginning (baseline) and end (post-treatment) of each case.
