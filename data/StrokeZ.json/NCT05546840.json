There are published recommendations and clinical guidelines to guide the care of stroke patients with regard to physical therapy. However, the status of current clinical practice is unknown.\n\nThis study aims to identify and describe the therapeutic approaches most used by physiotherapists in Catalonia in the care of stroke survivors in different phases of evolution.\n\nAn observational study will be carried out through an anonymous survey of physiotherapists in Catalonia. Through the College of Physiotherapists of Catalonia, all members will be invited to answer a survey on current clinical practice in the care of stroke survivors. The survey will collect data related to the physiotherapist's training and experience, the most frequently used therapeutic approaches, user profiles and institutions. It is intended to collect the data between October 2022 and February 2023. The data will be analyzed by the team of researchers"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","Physiotherapy","rehabilitation","catalonia","usual care"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"ECOLOGIC_OR_COMMUNITY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Demographic data","description":"Gender, Age, postal code, completion of degree studies, formation in neurology","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Specific formation in neurology","description":"CV information","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Neurorehabilitation experience","description":"Years of experience, work place,","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Multidisciplinary team","description":"Multidisciplinary co-workers such as Physical therapists, occupational therapists, medical doctors, psychologists","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Therapeutic intervention","description":"Sessions, doses, type of patients, type of intervention, approaches,","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Individual therapy","description":"Doses, time,","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Group Therapy","description":"Doses, Time","timeFrame":"Day 1"},{"measure":"Therapy","description":"Doses, time","timeFrame":"Day 1"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Physiotherapists who are currently working in Catalonia with patients who have suffered a stroke.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Physiotherapists do not currently work with at least one stroke patient","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"22 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Physiotherapists specialized in neurorehabilitation who in their day to day care for patients with stroke.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"University of Lleida","city":"Lleida","zip":"25198","country":"Spain","geoPoint":{"lat":41.61674,"lon":0.62218}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
