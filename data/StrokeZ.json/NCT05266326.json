As a special treatment for acute ischemic stroke, it has been used clinically in hospitals of traditional Chinese medicine in China for many years and has achieved certain efficacy. However, there is a lack of comprehensive and objective clinical observation and mechanism research on this treatment method, as well as a lack of scientific efficacy evaluation standards and technical specifications. Therefore, we planned to explore the effectiveness, safety and accessibility of bloodletting puncture in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke through a mixed-method study of a multi-center randomised controlled trial and focus group.","detailedDescription":"Ischemic stroke is a common disease of nervous system, with high morbidity, mortality and disability, which seriously threatens human health. According to the latest global burden of disease research, the overall lifetime risk of stroke in China is 39.9%, ranking first in the world. Intravenous thrombolysis is one of the most effective treatment methods for AIS at present. Although the recanalization rate of intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase can reach about 50%, in actual treatment, about 1/3 of patients experience reocclusion after thrombolytic therapy, resulting in neurological deterioration.\n\nThe bloodletting puncture as a traditional first aid measure in Chinese medicine could improves the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living, reduces the degree of neurological deficits and facilitates the recovery of consciousness in patients with impaired awareness. However, there is a lack of comprehensive and objective clinical observation and mechanistic studies on this treatment method, as well as a lack of scientific efficacy evaluation standards and technical specifications.\n\nThis is a mixed-method study of a multi-centre randomised controlled trial and focus group, and the subjects are patients with acute ischemic stroke within 72 hours of onset. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and accessibility of bloodletting puncture in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.\n\nSubjects who meet the inclusion criteria but do not meet the exclusion criteria are randomly divided into two groups:respectively, namely: Group 1 Test group （conventional Western medical treatment + bloodletting puncture）；Group 2 Control group （conventional Western medical treatment）.The total duration of bloodletting puncture treatment is 7 days. The patients are observed immediately after the end of bloodletting puncture treatment, 7 days after the end of bloodletting puncture treatment, and followed up to 14 days and 30 days after the start of bloodletting puncture treatment. The study endpoints included NIHSS score after 7 days of bloodletting puncture treatment (primary efficacy indicator), change from baseline values of NIHSS score, Glasgow score and mRS score after 7, 14 and 30 days of bloodletting puncture treatment (secondary efficacy indicators), stroke recurrence rate and mortality rate within 30 days (secondary efficacy indicators), and separate patients and physicians interviews at day 7 of bloodletting puncture treatment. The safety，efficacy and accessibility of bloodletting puncture in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke by statistical analysis of endpoint indicators."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Bloodletting puncture","Acupuncture","Traditional Chinese Medicine"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":360,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Test group","type":"OTHER","description":"conventional Western medical treatment + bloodletting puncture","interventionNames":["Other: Western medicine conventional treatment +Bloodletting puncture","Other: Western medicine conventional treatment"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"OTHER","description":"conventional Western medical treatment.","interventionNames":["Other: Western medicine conventional treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Western medicine conventional treatment +Bloodletting puncture","description":"All acupoints are positioned according to the WHO standard acupuncture point locations in the Western Pacific Region.
