It has a prospective monocentric randomized trial design. Patients will be randomized into parallel groups - intervention and control groups.\n\nA prospective monocentric randomized study lasting 8 months at the Department of Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine, University Hospital Ostrava. The study design is parallel with a test and control arm. Patients will be divided into an intervention (tested) group A with therapy on Armeo Spring and a control group B with conventional therapy, using a random number generator, where odd numbers represent arm A and even numbers represent arm B. A randomization table randomly allocates patients to therapy according to their order of entry into the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","rehabilitation","Armeo Spring therapy","quality of life"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The study participants will be enrolled into two parallel groups.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"No masking will be used in the study."}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Armeo Spring","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Study subjects randomized into this group will undergo physiotherapy sessions using the Armeo Spring device.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Armeo Spring physiotherapy"]},{"label":"Standard physiotherapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Study subjects randomized into this control group will undergo standard physiotherapy sessions.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Standard physiotherapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Armeo Spring physiotherapy","description":"Study subjects will undergo physiotherapy sessions using the Armeo Spring device.","armGroupLabels":["Armeo Spring"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Standard physiotherapy","description":"Study subjects will undergo standard physiotherapy sessions.","armGroupLabels":["Standard physiotherapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of upper extremity function - A GOAL","description":"Exercise A Goal is an assessment exercise that aims to evaluate the accuracy of the patient's gross motor movements. After placing the pointer on the base, the target will appear. The patient must try to catch the target in a perfectly linear motion and then stay exactly in the center of the target for 3 seconds.","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"Change of upper extremity function - HPR","description":"The HPR value (hand path ratio) is used to evaluate the quality of the patient's movement. It is calculated by dividing the length of the path of the patient's hand by the distance between the points to be grasped in the exercises. A perfectly straight movement has an HPR value of 1. An HPR value of 2 means that the path length of the patient's hand was twice as long as the shortest line connecting the points.","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"Change of upper extremity function - deviation","description":"The deviation shows the distance of the pointer to the center point of the target s, so it is the accuracy value on the target. The value describes the patient's ability to meet positional accuracy. A perfect match between the indicator and the resulting target position represents a deviation value of 0. A deviation value of 2 means that the patient missed the target position by 2 cm.","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"Change of upper extremity function - variability","description":"Variability represents the standard deviation of the points on the track from their average coordinates and is therefore a value of accuracy on target. The value describes the patient's ability to maintain a steady position. Maintaining a perfectly stable position has a variability value of 0. A variability of 2 cm means that 68% of the points on the track are within 2 cm.","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"Quality of Life - EQ-5D","description":"These are standardized questionnaires, i.e. providing exact results of measuring the quality of life in various domains of health status. The EQ-5D group of questionnaires is used worldwide and is one of the most widely used scales in healthcare. It has been certified and translated into many languages. Its use is validated by recent meta-analyses. The questionnaires monitor a total of 5 domains of quality of life - mobility, self-care, normal activities, pain, discomfort, anxiety and depression.","timeFrame":"3 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Frenchay Scale (MFS) test","description":"The Modified Frenchay Scale (MFS) measures active upper limb function in hemiparesis based on a video review of 10 everyday living tasks, each rated on a 10-point visual analogic scale.
