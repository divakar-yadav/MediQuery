Subjects without a clinical diagnosis of dementia and with a Mini Mental State Examination score (MMSE) score ≥ 25 will undergo neurocognitive assessment (MoCA), psychosocial and QoL assessment before randomization.\n\nSubjects will undergo regular visits (in-clinic, and/or by phone, or video conferencing) every 6 months during the treatment period. Subjects will take either rivaroxaban 15 mg or standard of care.\n\nAn independent clinical event committee will classify all endpoint events.
