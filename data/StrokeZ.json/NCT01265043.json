An additional aim is to assess potential longer term oral intervention-related health and HRQoL outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["oral health","oral hygiene","bacteria","quality of life","Clinical oral health in patients following acute stroke","Oral opportunistic pathogens in patients following acute stroke","Oral health-related quality of life in patients following acute stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":102,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"OHI","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients provided with oral hygiene instruction and electric toothbrush","interventionNames":["Other: Oral hygiene intervention"]},{"label":"OHI + CHX mouthrinse","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients provided with oral hygiene instruction and Corsodyl mouthrinse","interventionNames":["Other: Oral hygiene intervention"]},{"label":"OHI + CHX mouthrinse + assisted brushing","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Oral hygiene instruction, Corsodyl mouthrinse, and assisted brushing","interventionNames":["Other: Oral hygiene intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Oral hygiene intervention","description":"Oral health promotion intervention","armGroupLabels":["OHI","OHI + CHX mouthrinse","OHI + CHX mouthrinse + assisted brushing"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in plaque scores over course of trial","timeFrame":"Three week in-hospital rehabilitation period"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in gingival bleeding scores over course of trial","timeFrame":"three week in-hospital rehabilitation period"},{"measure":"Change in oral colonization by aerobic and facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli over course of trial","timeFrame":"Three week in-hospital rehabilitation period"},{"measure":"Change in oral colonization by Staphylococcus aureus over course of trial","timeFrame":"Three week in-hospital rehabilitation period"},{"measure":"Change in oral colonization by yeasts over course of trial","timeFrame":"Three week in-hospital rehabilitation period"},{"measure":"Change in health-related quality of life over course of trial","timeFrame":"three week in-hospital rehabilitation period"},{"measure":"Change in oral health-related quality of life over course of trial","timeFrame":"Three week in-hospital rehabilitation period"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Aged 50 years and over\n* Moderate to severe stroke (Barthel Index \\>/= 70)\n* Admitted to Rehabilitation Unit within 7 days\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with naso-gastric feeding tube\n* Edentulous patients\n* Patients with communication difficulties","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Otto LT Lam, BDS, BSc, PhD","affiliation":"The University of Hong Kong","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Tung Wah Hospital","city":"Hong Kong","country":"Hong Kong","geoPoint":{"lat":22.27832,"lon":114.17469}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"22818804","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Lam OL, McMillan AS, Samaranayake LP, Li LS, McGrath C.
