This study investigates the effectiveness of an interactive web-based mobile reminder calendar, (RemindMe). The calendar sends text messages to the user's mobile phone as support in everyday life, for persons with cognitive impairment due to neurological injury/diagnoses. The study has a randomized controlled trial design with data collection at baseline and at follow-up sessions after two and four months. Data collection started in October 2016 and continued until February 2018. RemindMe may give the needed support to remind the person and thus increase the ability to perform activities and to become independent in everyday life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cognitive Impairments","Stroke","Brain Injuries"],"keywords":["Self-Help Devices","Occupational Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants receive rehabilitation as usual and training how to use RemindMe by personnel from the research group and an occupational therapist working at the rehabilitation clinic.
