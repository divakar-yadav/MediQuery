The primary endpoint of this substudy will be the rate of occurrence of new carotid plaque, with the hypothesis that Rate of plaque occurrence in the \\<100 mg/dL group will be 25% after 3 years (45% in EVA when atherosclerosis was present at baseline) RRR of plaque of 25% in the \\<70 mg/dL group Alpha 5%, power 80%\n\nAs an ancillary study, 1000 patients will participate in the TST-PGS (Pharmacogenetics) Study, in which they will have 1 blood sampling either at baseline or during one of the follow-up visits of TST. The aim of this study is to show that the benefit (risk of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death) observed with a strategy of LDL-C \\<0.7 g / l compared to a strategy of LDL-C to 1 ± 0.1 g / l is higher in carriers of polymorphism 719Arg of the gene KIF-6 than non-carriers of this polymorphism."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Transient Ischemic
