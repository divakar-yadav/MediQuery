For a few years now, the measurement of the photomotor reflex by quantitative Pupillometry has been routinely performed in Intensive Care Units. The objective of this work is to see if Transcranial Doppler recorded parameters and Pupillary parameters are correlated to the neurological prognosis evaluated at 9 months by the Modified Rankin Score (mRS) and the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOS-E)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Damage"],"keywords":["Brain injury","Transcranial Doppler","Quantitative Pupillometry,","neurological prognosis","modified Rankin Score (mRS)","Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOS-E)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":73,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"brain damaged patients","description":"All major brain damaged patients (stroke or head trauma) admitted to reanimation will be included.\n\nIn the usual practice, they have a Transcranial Doppler and the measurement of the photomotor reflex by quantitative Pupillometry.\n\nIt is planned to collect the simultaneous values of the different parameters during 2,000 measurements.\n\nThe data will be collected retrospectively from 01/12/2020, and prospectively from 01/04/2021.","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial Doppler","Device: Pupillometry."]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Transcranial Doppler","description":"This device measures Mean Systolic Velocity (VMS), Tele-Diastolic Velocity (TDV) and Pulsatility Index (PI),","armGroupLabels":["brain damaged patients"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Pupillometry.","description":"This device measures the photomotor reflex (basic pupil diameter, percentage of variation, latent and slope of the standard photomotor reflex)","armGroupLabels":["brain damaged patients"],"otherNames":["AlgiScan"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Score (mRS) (0-5)","description":"Modified Rankin Score (mRS) measures the degree of disability following a stroke in a patient (level 0 for patients with no symptoms to level 5 for patients with major disability and total dependency)..","timeFrame":"Year: 1"},{"measure":"Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOS-E) (1-8)","description":"Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOS-E) measure the impact of brain injured (minimum at 1 (Dead) and maximum at 8 (Upper Good Recovery).","timeFrame":"Year: 1"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mean Systolic Velocity (VMS)","description":"Measured by Transcranial Doppler right and left.","timeFrame":"At inclusion"},{"measure":"Intra-Cranial Pressure (ICP)","description":"Collect on medical file.","timeFrame":"At inclusion"},{"measure":"Pulsatility Index (PI)","description":"Measured by Transcranial Doppler right and left.","timeFrame":"At inclusion"},{"measure":"Tele-Diastolic Velocity (TDV)","description":"Measured by Transcranial Doppler right and left.","timeFrame":"At inclusion"},{"measure":"Basic pupil diameter","description":"Measured by Pupillometry right and left","timeFrame":"At inclusion"},{"measure":"Percentage of variation of the pupil diameter","description":"Measured by Pupillometry right and left","timeFrame":"At inclusion"},{"measure":"Latent and slope of the standard photomotor reflex","description":"Measured by Pupillometry right and left","timeFrame":"At inclusion"},{"measure":"Tissue Partial Oxygen Pressure (PtiO2)","description":"Collect on medical file.","timeFrame":"At inclusion"},{"measure":"Bispectral Index (BIS)","description":"Collect on medical file.
