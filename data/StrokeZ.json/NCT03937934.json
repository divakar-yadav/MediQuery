Once all participants are enrolled, they will be given weekly boxes of food which includes materials for a nutritious recipe and extra fruit and vegetables for a total of 6 weeks. The SNAP-Ed Educator and SHIP Public health coordinator will be present at food pick up to answer questions about the boxes, food preparation, etc. They will be given the option of participating in grocery store and farmer's market tours, as well as sign up for text messaging of nutrition information and recipes. At the end of 6 weeks, they will be asked to participate in a focus group. At baseline, 3 months and 6 months, they will be asked to complete a survey on lifestyle behaviors and food choices."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes","High Blood Pressure","Obesity","Hypertension","Heart Diseases","Stroke","TIA","Osteoarthritis","Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Subjects with long term health condition","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects that have been identified as having food insecurity based on a two question screening tool, and also has one of more of the following chronic diseases Hypertension, Heart disease, Stroke/TIA, DM 2, Cancer/history of cancer, obesity or osteoarthritis will receive weekly nutrition educaiton","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Nutrition Education"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Nutrition Education","description":"Weekly box of healthy groceries and nutrition education including a recipe, food to make the recipe, extra fruit and vegetables.","armGroupLabels":["Subjects with long term health condition"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in the number of self-reported fruits per day","description":"Number of self-reported fruits per day","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 months, 6 months"},{"measure":"Change in the number of self-reported vegetables per day","description":"Number of self-reported vegetables per day","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 months, 6 months"},{"measure":"Change in number of days a week and minutes per day participants participate in physical activity and sedentary activity","description":"Measured using self-reported Food Rx Pilot survey","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 months, 6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in A1c","description":"Identified through chart review","timeFrame":"6 months and 12 months"},{"measure":"Change in BMI kg/m2 (weight in kg, height in meters)","description":"Identified through chart review","timeFrame":"6 months and 12 months"},{"measure":"Change in Systolic and/or Diastolic Hypertension mmHg","description":"Identified through chart review","timeFrame":"6 months and 12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adult patients that have been identified as having food insecurity based on a two question screening tool, AND\n* Also has one of more of the following chronic diseases:\n* Hypertension,\n* Heart disease,\n* Stroke/TIA,\n* DM 2,\n* Cancer/history of cancer,\n* obesity\n* osteoarthritis\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnant women\n* Children","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Erin Westfall, DO","affiliation":"Mayo Clinic","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Mayo Clinic Health System","city":"Mankato","state":"Minnesota","zip":"56001","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":44.15906,"lon":-94.00915}}]},"referencesModule":{"seeAlsoLinks":[{"label":"Mayo Clinic Clinical Trials","url":"https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials"}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000006973","term":"Hypertension"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M12391","name":"Obesity","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6805","name":"Diabetes Mellitus","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9714","name":"Hypertension","asFound":"High Blood Pressure","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M12616","name":"Osteoarthritis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","asFound":"Heart Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC19","name":"Gland and Hormone Related Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
