Secondary objectives are to evaluate the association between non-adherence and clinical events, to identify predictors of non-adherence and to compare objective measures of adherence with self-reporting.\n\nKey methodological instrument for this study will be the \"Time4Med\" pillbox with Smart/ Reminder Card. The study includes 3 visits (baseline visit 0, follow-up visit 1 and end-of-study visit 2) with a total follow-up of 9 months.\n\nAfter an initial 3-month observational phase with electronic monitoring of adherence using the \"Smart Card\", all patients will receive counselling based on their electronically recorded drug intake data, as well as a multicompartment pillbox. Patients will be then randomised to one of two groups in a crossover design, so that in the subsequent 6-month interventional phase one group will use a (reminder-delivering) \"Reminder Card\" for the first 3 months and the \"Smart Card\" for the last 3 months, while the second group will use the cards in reverse order."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Adherence, Patient","Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke, direct oral anticoagulants, adherence, electronic monitoring, adherence-improving intervention, polypharmacy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":130,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group 1","type":"OTHER","description":"Intake reminders followed by crossover to no intake reminders","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Medication intake reminders","Behavioral: Pillbox use and counselling"]},{"label":"Group 2","type":"OTHER","description":"No intake reminders followed by crossover to intake reminders","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Medication intake reminders","Behavioral: Pillbox use and counselling"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Medication intake reminders","description":"Acoustic and visual alarm at predefined DOAC-intake timepoints.","armGroupLabels":["Group 1","Group 2"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Pillbox use and counselling","description":"All patients will be counselled based on their previous electronically recorded adherence data and will be given a multicompartment pillbox für daily use","armGroupLabels":["Group 1","Group 2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of non-optimal timing adherence to DOACs","description":"Non-optimal timing adherence is defined as at least one DOAC dose not recorded or recorded outside of 25% of the prescribed dosing time schedule","timeFrame":"0 - 3 months, 3 - 6 months, 6 - 9 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of non-optimal taking adherence to DOACs","description":"Non-optimal taking adherence to DOACs is defined as at least one DOAC dose not recorded","timeFrame":"0 - 3 months, 3 - 6 months, 6 - 9 months"},{"measure":"Change of timing adherence to DOACs","description":"Timing adherence to DOACs is defined as the proportion of prescribed DOAC doses taken within 25% of the prescribed dosing time schedule","timeFrame":"0 - 3 months, 3 - 6 months, 6 - 9 months"},{"measure":"Change of taking adherence to DOACs","description":"Taking adherence to DOACs is defined as the proportion of prescribed DOAC doses taken.","timeFrame":"0 - 3 months, 3 - 6 months, 6 - 9 months"},{"measure":"Self-reported adherence to DOACs","description":"Self-reported adherence to DOACs is captured on various questionnaires","timeFrame":"0 - 6 months"},{"measure":"Clinical vascular events or death","description":"Recurrent ischaemic stroke or TIA, intracranial hemorrhage, major extracranial hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism and death","timeFrame":"up to 9 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Signed informed consent form (ICF)\n* Adult patients (≥ 18 years)\n* Hospitalization for acute ischaemic stroke (including TIA with positive neuroimaging)\n* DOAC treatment for atrial fibrillation or embolic stroke of undetermined source\n* Patients receiving polypharmacy, defined as at least 3 drugs (including DOAC treatment)\n* Patients self-administering their medication\n* Patients already using a pillbox or willing to use one\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients not able or unwilling to sign ICF\n* Medication administration by caregiver - Filling of the pillbox by a pharmacy, relatives or other caregivers does not exclude the patients, provided that they self-administer their medication\n* Patients who are, in the opinion of the investigator, unlikely to adhere to the study schedule or are unsuitable for any other reason","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Philippe A Lyrer, MD","affiliation":"University Hospital Basel, Stroke Center and Department of Neurology","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Kurt Hersberger, MSc, PhD","affiliation":"University of Basel, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University Hospital Basel","city":"Basel","zip":"4031","country":"Switzerland","geoPoint":{"lat":47.55839,"lon":7.57327}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"34081196","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Dietrich F, Polymeris AA, Verbeek M, Engelter ST, Hersberger KE, Schaedelin S, Arnet I, Lyrer PA.
