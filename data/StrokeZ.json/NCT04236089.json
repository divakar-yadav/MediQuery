A mirror robotic hand system was developed, which consisted with a wearable exoskeletal hand, sensor glove, and a control box. The patient's unaffected hand wears the sensor glove, the affected hand wears the wearable exoskeleton hand, and the unaffected hand does the certain transitive and intransitive tasks as the mirror group, and then makes the affected hand do the same movements driven by the exoskeleton robotic hand. The investigators hypothesize that combining both approaches might facilitate the sensorimotor cortex that controls movement and might augment somatosensory input and further treatment efficacy. This study is aimed at investigating the effects of Mirror therapy and robotic mirror therapy on motor cortical activations in healthy adults and stroke patients using electroencephalography. All participants will perform the conditions of resting, moving right hand with or without robotic hand as the baseline data, then they will do mirror therapy using the right hand as active hand, or wearing robotic hand doing mirror therapy in random sequence. Electroencephalography (EEG) assessment will be done to assess the neurophysiologic effects of the different interventions. The investigators will use a questionnaire to assess the subjective opinion about the different interventions.\n\ncombined with execution (video AOE). The investigators will use the pair-t test to assess the within subjects differences in EEG and the questionnaire results.\n\nThis study will be done during 2020/02/01 - 2021/03/31."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Healthy Adults","Stroke Patients"],"keywords":["mirror therapy","robotic mirror therapy","Electroencephalography","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":65,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"mirror therapy of healthy adults","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Traditional mirror therapy in electroencephalography of healthy adults."},{"label":"robotic mirror therapy of healthy adults","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Robotic mirror therapy in electroencephalography of healthy adults.","interventionNames":["Device: robotic hand"]},{"label":"mirror therapy of stroke patients","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Traditional mirror therapy in electroencephalography of stroke patients."},{"label":"robotic mirror therapy of stroke patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Robotic mirror therapy in electroencephalography of stroke patients.","interventionNames":["Device: robotic hand"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"robotic hand","description":"mirror therapy with robotic hand","armGroupLabels":["robotic mirror therapy of healthy adults","robotic mirror therapy of stroke patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Electroencephalography assessment","description":"Compare the brainwave of the different interventions through Fourier Transform","timeFrame":"1.5hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Questionnaire","description":"Collect the subjective opinion about the different interventions","timeFrame":"30 minutes"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* healthy adults: right handed, with normal upper extremity and cognition functions\n* stroke patients:one side upper limb spasticity\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* 1. wrist weakness or deformity 2. skin problem 3. musculoskeletal injury of upper extremities","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Department of Rehabilitation, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Kaohsiung Medical Center, Kaohsiung, Taiwan","city":"Kaohsiung","zip":"833","country":"Taiwan","geoPoint":{"lat":22.61626,"lon":120.31333}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
