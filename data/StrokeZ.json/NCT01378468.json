The investigators hypothesise that the results of a standardised oral triglyceride tolerance test in the subacute setting (3-7 days) after the first ischaemic stroke are associated with the risk of recurrent stroke within 12 months after the index event.","detailedDescription":"Since high postprandial triglycerides levels may be a risk factor for stroke, we use a combined oral triglyceride and glucose tolerance test in patients who had a first ischemic stroke. Follow-up after one year primarily assesses wether or not a recurrent stroke has occured. The glucose tolerance test is meant to identify patients with metabolic syndrome (and diabetes), since this condition is per se associated with increased levels of triglycerides. Potentially, the post-challenge triglyceride levels only play a role in patients without diabetes or metabolic syndrome. For further details see Ebinger et al. 'The Berlin 'Cream\\&Sugar' Study: the prognostic impact of an oral triglyceride tolerance test in patients after acute ischaemic stroke', IJS; 2010,5, 47-51."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["First Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":573,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with first ischemic stroke","interventionNames":["Other: oral triglyceride tolerance test (not a therapeutic \"intervention\" as such but a new diagnostic test)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"oral triglyceride tolerance test (not a therapeutic \"intervention\" as such but a new diagnostic test)","description":"see Ebinger et al., IJS, 2010","armGroupLabels":["Patients with first ischemic stroke"],"otherNames":["cream"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrent Stroke","description":"The primary end-point of the study is a recurrent fatal or nonfatal stroke within the first 12 months after the event.","timeFrame":"outcome measure is assessed one year after first ischemic stroke."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"MI","description":"Myocardial infarction","timeFrame":"one year after first ischemic stroke"},{"measure":"death","description":"cardiovascular death (death due to any cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event)","timeFrame":"one year after first ischemic stroke"},{"measure":"TIA","description":"transient ischemic attack","timeFrame":"one year after first ischemic stroke"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age over 18 years\n* First ischemic stroke\n* Incidence within less than 7 days\n* Informed consent obtained\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Aphasia (if hampering informed consent)\n* Swallowing disorder\n* Pregnancy\n* Renal or hepatic failure\n* Pancreatitis\n* Cholecystolithiasis\n* Malabsorption\n* Lactose intolerance\n* Psychosis\n* Drug and/or alcohol addiction\n* Expected life expectancyr12 months\n* Inability to sign informed consent\n* Acute coronary syndrome\n* Severe heart valve disorder\n* Heart failure (NYHA III-IV)\n* Severe infectious/rheumatic disease\n* Sever metabolic disease\n* No oral glucose tolerance test in case of known diabetes","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"the study population consists of adults with first ischemic stroke within the last three to seven days (at time of testing).","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Martin Ebinger","affiliation":"CSB","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Matthias Endres","affiliation":"CSB","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin","city":"Berlin","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":52.52437,"lon":13.41053}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"20446947","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Ebinger M, Heuschmann PU, Jungehuelsing GJ, Werner C, Laufs U, Endres M.
