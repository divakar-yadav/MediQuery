The main aim is to accurately identify SM in order to minimize the risk of receiving inappropriate treatment and possible development of complications, which can have a negative impact on the patient´s health. The project includes an analysis of pharmacoeconomic parameters. It will examine saved costs in the case of non-administration of unindicated treatment and it will compare the number of adverse events related to the administration of unindicated treatment in patients diagnosed with SM.","detailedDescription":"The project has been designed as a prospective multicentre observational clinical research with applied outcomes leading to an improved provision of healthcare and healthcare costs. All patients older than 18 years admitted with suspected stroke will be included in the project.\n\nThe project will be implemented in 2 hospitals in the Czech Republic, namely the University Hospital in Ostrava and the Hospital in České Budějovice. The analyses will be performed at the University of Ostrava.\n\nThe primary objective of the project is to refine hospital diagnostics through the use of multimodal brain imaging (non-contrast CT (NCCT), CT angiography (CTA), and CT perfusion (CTP)) at hospital admission. The expected difference is at least 10% more patients with SM in the group diagnosed by the multimodal CT examination when compared to the group diagnosed with NCCT or NCCT/CTA. The primary objective is to demonstrate the specificity and sensitivity of multimodal brain imaging (NCCT, CTA, and CTP) when compared to the use of NCCT or NCCT/CTA in the acute diagnostics of SM in patients with a sudden focal neurological deficit (minimum 1 point on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale - NIHSS) within 24 hours from the onset of symptoms.\n\nIn addition to the importance of CTP in the diagnosis of stroke mimics, we will also analyze the significance of other clinical data.\n\nThe secondary objective is to compare the economic indicators and costs that will be saved by not providing inadequate treatment to patients with SM."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Mimics"],"keywords":["stroke mimics","neurological disorders","cerebrovascular accident","brain disorders","computer tomography","CT angiography","non-contrast head computed tomography","intravenous thrombolysis","National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with neurological deficits (stroke or SM)","description":"All patients with acute neurological deficits (stroke or SM) will undergo neuroimaging diagnostic procedures initial multimodal brain CT (NCCT, CTP, CTA); then the follow-up NCCT within 24-36 hours.\n\nAll patients without a confirmed concordant hypoperfusion or cerebral ischemia on their previous CT scans will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination between the 3rd and 7th day after the admission to the hospital in order to confirm the diagnosis of SM.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Multimodal brain CT","Diagnostic Test: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Multimodal brain CT","description":"Multimodal brain CT includes NCCT, CTP, and CTA","armGroupLabels":["Patients with neurological deficits (stroke or SM)"]},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)","description":"MRI examination will be performed between the 3rd and 7th day after the admission to the hospital","armGroupLabels":["Patients with neurological deficits (stroke or SM)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The difference of patients with SM","description":"The primary objective is to demonstrate the specificity and sensitivity of multimodal brain imaging (NCCT, CTA and CTP) when compared to the use of NCCT or NCCT/CTA in the acute diagnostics of SM in patients with a sudden focal neurological deficit (minimum 1 point on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale - NIHSS) within 24 hours from the onset of symptoms.

Economic evaluation is organised as a test of dominance of improved results (meaning less complications associated with the administration of thrombolysis) and lower costs.\n\nIn order to calculate the overall benefit, the value of the Quality of Life and the specific parameter of the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) set for the Czech Republic will be used.
