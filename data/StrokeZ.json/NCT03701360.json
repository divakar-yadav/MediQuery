It is to mainly observe the patients' prognosis following the prescription of clopidogrel resinate and aspirin, collect relevant data and create big data for stroke. Based on this data, an AI, using various advanced statistical methodologies and deep learning techniques will be developed, and offer information regarding stroke prognosis by extracting markers that are characteristic of the relationship between stroke and the study drug.\n\nThese analyses and results will include information on which drug regimen will better prevent the progression or recurrence of stroke by considering individual patient conditions. This is a pragmatic trial based on the prescription and treatment processes of routine clinical practice. Thus, there is no major restriction and with only the minimum exclusion criteria in place, it does not hinder usual clinical practices. Therefore, selecting and changing a patient's antiplatelet agents should be a rational medical judgment made by the patient's attending physician. The study will proceed without any major change in the sequence of routine clinical examinations, prescriptions, treatments, observations, etc. Provided, the process of storing and analyzing relevant information will be added to each study procedure in accordance with study methodologies and conditions no other special efforts or limitations will be required.\n\nThe data will be collected prospectively, and the AI will generate brain imaging data and prognostic indicators for 3-months after stroke has occurred. The performance of the AI will be verified with independent test sets."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1199,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Aspirin alone group","description":"- Aspirin: 75\\~100mg once per day, initial loading dose of 300\\~500mg/d is allowed"},{"label":"Aspirin + Clopidogrel resinate group","description":"* Aspirin: 75\\~100mg once per day, initial loading dose of 300\\~500mg/d is allowed\n* Clopidogrel resinate: 75mg once per day, initial loading dose of 300mg/d is allowed"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of patients with neurological deterioration under hospital treatment.","description":"Rapid worsening of an existing focal neurological deficit or rapid onset of a new focal neurological deficit (â‰¥ 24 hours) that is clinically judged by the Investigator not to be attributable to non-ischemic etiology.","timeFrame":"up to 3 months after stroke onset"},{"measure":"Rate of patients with new ischemic stroke under hospital treatment.","description":"* Rapid onset of a new focal neurological deficit with clinical or imaging evidence of infarction and not attributable to a non-ischemic etiology (not associated with brain infection, trauma, tumor, seizure, severe metabolic disease, or degenerative neurological disease); or,\n* Rapid worsening of an existing focal neurological deficit that is judged by the Investigator to be attributable to a new infarction.
