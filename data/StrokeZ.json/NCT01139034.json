By applying low-frequency electrical stimulation to the target muscle groups, improvements may be observed in terms of muscle strength, subluxation, and passive humeral lateral rotation of the shoulder joint. In order to overcome issues regarding the integration of an FES and a rehabilitation robot, group members have designed a customized FES system approved by medical safety regulations. Despite sharing identical specifications with commercial models, the approved 2-channel FES system provides better integrity and control when working with the upper extremity rehabilitation robot. In this study, three patients with unilateral shoulder subluxation will be recruited. Limited shoulder x-ray photos shall be taken before, during, and after the FES shoulder subluxation treatment for studying the effects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"shoulder FES treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Self-designed surface functional electrical stimulator"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Self-designed surface functional electrical stimulator","description":"Use the self-designed surface functional electrical stimulator to improve the shoulder joint subluxation.","armGroupLabels":["shoulder FES treatment"],"otherNames":["Self-designed surface functional electrical stimulation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Upward migration index","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Acromiohumeral distance","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* stroke (1-3 months)\n* Brunnstrom Stage I-III\n* single, unilateral\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* aphasic\n* shoulder impairment\n* severe osteoporosis\n* cardiac arrhythmias or having a pacemaker implanted\n* abnormal cutaneous sensation at the target areas","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"25 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Jin-Shin Lai","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+886-2-23123456","phoneExt":"66583","email":"jslai@ntu.edu.tw"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Jin-Shin Lai, MD","affiliation":"Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, NTUH, Taipei, Taiwan","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, NTUH","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Taipei","country":"Taiwan","contacts":[{"name":"Jin-Shin Lai","role":"CONTACT","phone":"886-2-23123456","phoneExt":"66583","email":"jslai@ntu.edu.tw"},{"name":"Jin-Shin Lai, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":25.04776,"lon":121.53185}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
