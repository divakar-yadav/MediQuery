With improving survival rates and longer life expectancy in general, the burden of caring for stroke survivors is likely to increase. As a lack of upper limb recovery results in significant dependence and a reduced quality of life. Persistent upper limb (UL) dysfunction after a stroke is one of the most challenging issues in rehabilitation. Effective upper limb treatment interventions have therefore been identified as a priority for stroke research. One of the rehabilitation strategies include performing self-administered exercises using VR games technology. Effective treatment interventions post-stroke is characterized by high intensity and repetitive practice of a meaningful task. However, changes in infrastructure, an emphasis on mobility during early rehabilitation ,to reduce hospital length of stay and a lack of therapy on discharge home have resulted in challenges delivering the amount of rehabilitation necessary to optimize recovery. A promising technique, which has the capability of creating an interactive environment in which practice intensity and feedback can be manipulated to retrain movement in the upper limb in people with stroke, is virtual reality (VR) technology .VR provides a sense of illusion: of being immersed in a world where objects can he visualized and interact with. The system is usually a controlled one, where the objects and interaction styles (point, touch, grasp) are defined prior to the controlling program being executed. There are a number of ways in which the virtual environment (VE) can he presented to the user. Most common are desktop (fish tank) VR systems where the VE is displayed on a standard desktop monitor. The user can interact with the environment via standard hardware (keyboard, mouse) or via specialized VR devices such as data gloves, hut is conscious of 'looking at' the environment rather than 'immersed in' the environment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["intensive virtual reality","upper limb functions"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Interventional Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Virtual reality games +conventional exercises","interventionNames":["Other: Virtual reality games +conventional exercises"]},{"label":"control Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Conventional exercises","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional exercises"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Virtual reality games +conventional exercises","description":"Virtual reality games +conventional exercises","armGroupLabels":["Interventional Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional exercises","description":"Conventional exercises","armGroupLabels":["control Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl- Meyer assessment upper extremity","description":"The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index.
