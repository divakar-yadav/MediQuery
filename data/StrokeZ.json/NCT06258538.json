The program could enhance UE functions, improving daily function, decrease caregiver burden and lower medical expenses associated with long-term care. Professionals can use these findings to promote the application of clinically empirical research and better understand the effects and mechanisms of circuit training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Patients"],"keywords":["Stroke rehabilitation","distal upper extremity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":87,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"distal robot-assisted and task-oriented therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the Circuit group received interventions for 20-min exoskeleton(EXO) and 20-min end-effector(EE) robot-assisted therapy, followed by 20-min uni- and 20-min bi- task-oriented therapy/session, 3 sessions/week for 6 consecutive weeks.","interventionNames":["Device: Robots can aid in distal UE rehabilitation through exoskeleton (EXO)","Device: End-effector robot-assisted therapy (EE)","Behavioral: Unilateral task-oriented therapy","Behavioral: Bilateral task-oriented therapy"]},{"label":"distal robot-assisted therapy alone","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the Robot group received interventions for 40-min exoskeleton(EXO) and 40-min end-effector(EE) robot-assisted therapy/session, 3 sessions/week for 6 consecutive weeks.","interventionNames":["Device: Robots can aid in distal UE rehabilitation through exoskeleton (EXO)","Device: End-effector robot-assisted therapy (EE)"]},{"label":"task-oriented therapy alone","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants in the task-oriented therapy(TOT) group received interventions for 40-min uni- and 40-min bi- task-oriented therapy/session, 3 sessions/week for 6 consecutive weeks.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Unilateral task-oriented therapy","Behavioral: Bilateral task-oriented therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Robots can aid in distal UE rehabilitation through exoskeleton (EXO)","description":"Exoskeleton robot-assisted therapy Each EXO robot-assisted therapy session consists of continuous passive motion (30 percent of duration), active-assisted training (30 percent of duration), and interactive training (40 percent of duration) using the Hand of Hope (HOH) robotic hand system .
