Totally, patients with upper limb hemiplegia after stroke, who were admitted in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine of two hospitals, were enrolled. The study lasted 30 days for each participant. The patients enrolled were randomly divided into the experimental group and the control group, all under routine rehabilitation therapy. Additionally, the patients in the experimental group were given modified mirror therapy.","detailedDescription":"Upper limb hemiparesis is a motor and sensory disorder that occurs after stroke, with an incidence rate of up to 55% to 75%. Effective upper limb rehabilitation methods help reduce the occurrence of disuse syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome. Therefore, finding active and effective limb rehabilitation methods has important practical significance.This was a randomized controlled study in China conducted during Aug. 2022 to Aug. 2023. Totally, patients with upper limb hemiplegia after stroke, who were admitted in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine of two hospitals, were enrolled. The study lasted 30 days for each participant. The patients enrolled were randomly divided into the experimental group and the control group, all under routine rehabilitation therapy. Additionally, the patients in the experimental group were given modified mirror therapy.

After the video ended, only the instructions and synchronized music were played. The patient was required to sit in front of a mirror table, with the mirror placed between both arms and facing the healthy side. The patient was required to recall the video based on the verbal instructions while using the healthy side to perform movement training. They were also asked to observe the reflected motion of the healthy limb in the mirror, simultaneously imagining the affected limb moving in sync (the patient focused on the front of the mirror, avoiding direct eye contact with the healthy hand, to create the sensation that it was the affected hand performing the movements).","armGroupLabels":["modified mirror therapy+Modified mirror therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity","description":"The Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity was used to evaluate the patient's upper limb function and motor control. It included the assessment of movements in the shoulder, elbow joint, wrist, and fingers. During the assessment, the assessor observed and recorded the patient's abilities and limitations in specific actions. Based on the patient's performance in each sub-item, the assessor assigned a score using a 0-2 scale, a score of 0 indicating inability to perform, 1 indicating partial ability, and 2 indicating full ability. Finally, the scores for each sub-item were summed up to obtain an overall upper limb function score of 0-66, with scores positively correlated with the upper limb function.","timeFrame":"day 1 and day 30"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"the coordinated contraction rate-Surface electromyography-The biceps brachii","description":"The surface electromyography (sEMG) was used to assess the coordinated contraction rates of the biceps brachii on the affected upper limb. The surface electromyography device was used for detection, with the most prominent part of muscle belly of the biceps brachii serving as the monitoring points. During the maximum isometric voluntary contraction (MIVC) state of elbow flexion or extension, two channels were used to separately record the integrated electromyographic values (iEMG) of the biceps brachii, and the antagonists. Measurements were taken three times to obtain the maximum value, and the coordinated contraction rate (CR) during elbow flexion or extension under MIVC conditions was calculated using the formula: CR (%) = Antagonist muscle iEMG / (Agonist muscle iEMG + Antagonist muscle iEMG).","timeFrame":"day 1 and day 30"},{"measure":"the coordinated contraction rate-Surface electromyography-The triceps brachii","description":"The surface electromyography (sEMG) was used to assess the coordinated contraction rates of the triceps brachii on the affected upper limb.
