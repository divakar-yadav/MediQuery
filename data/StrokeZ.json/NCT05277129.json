It has been proposed that a proportion of the patients develop an autoimmune immune response, and that this could potentially explain the cognitive decline in some of the patients. The current study aims to investigate this hypothesis in a subgroup of patients with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Dementia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patients","interventionNames":["Other: Analysis of post-stroke immune responses"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Analysis of post-stroke immune responses","description":"Analysis of immune responses in peripheral blood","armGroupLabels":["Stroke patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The B cell and T cell response in peripheral blood","timeFrame":"1 day (subject inclusion)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Stroke \\< 72 h\n* Age \\> 18 years\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Brain hemorrhage verified by CT or MRI scan\n* Previous or present immunological disease or other serious comorbidity\n* Ongoing immune respons after infection or vaccination \\< 1 month\n* Cognitive without ability to understand and/or give an informed consent to participate in the study","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients suffering from acute cerebral infarction","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Andreas Lossius, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+47 930 68 515","email":"postmottak@medisin.uio.no"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Akershus University Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"LÃ¸renskog","country":"Norway","contacts":[{"name":"Andreas Lossius, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":59.92625,"lon":10.95422}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6594","name":"Dementia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
