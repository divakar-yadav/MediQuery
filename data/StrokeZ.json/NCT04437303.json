Stroke is a feared complication of TAVI, with an incidence of around 4-5% in the first 30 days. Up to 50% of patients undergoing TAVI have an indication for oral anticoagulants (OAC) mostly for atrial fibrillation. OAC use during TAVI could increase bleeding complications, but interruption during TAVI may increase the risk for thromboembolic events (i.e. stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction). Recent observational data suggest that periprocedural continuation of OAC is safe and might decrease the risk of stroke. Beside the potential reduction of thromboembolic events, continuation of OAC is associated with an evident clinical ancillary benefit for patients and staff. Since periprocedural OAC interruption not infrequently leads to misunderstanding and potentially dangerous situations, when patients are not properly informed before hospital admission or may experience difficulties with the interruption regimen.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nPeriprocedural continuation of oral anticoagulants is safe and might decrease thromboembolic complications without an increase in bleeding complications at 30 days"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aortic Valve Disease","Aortic Valve Stenosis","Stroke","Bleeding","Vascular Complications","Myocardial Infarction","Thrombosis
