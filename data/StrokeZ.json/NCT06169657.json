Additionally, the researchers will compare physical therapist (PT) burden across these modalities and patient functional presentation levels.","detailedDescription":"Aim 1 of this study is to measure stepping repetition and intensity via heart rate of three gait-training modalities utilized with patients in the subacute phase of stroke and iSCI during inpatient rehabilitation in order to guide therapists through clinical decision-making of selecting the optimal intervention for patients based on functional presentation. Aim 2 of this study is to measure therapist burden across each gait training modalities, as this is an additional factor that contributes to the number of steps taken and intensity experienced by the patient.\n\nThe gait training modalities assessed will include BWSTT, overground gait training with a lower extremity exoskeleton, and overground gait training with BWS. The participants' functional level will be classified by gait speed obtained via the 10 meter walk test (10MWT), a standardized assessment commonly used in rehabilitation. These functional classification categories include household ambulator (low level) and limited community ambulator (high level), determined by Fritz et al. 2009.\n\nThe researchers hypothesize that low functioning/household ambulators will achieve more minutes in high-intensity training zones utilizing the exoskeleton due to the enhanced participation and increased weight-bearing the device supports compared to the other modalities. In addition, a greater number steps will be achieved in this mode due to the exoskeleton's ability to decrease overall therapist burden compared to BWSTT and overground with BWS. In contrast, the researchers anticipate that steps per session and overall intensity will be decreased in high functioning/limited community ambulators due the unnecessary support the exoskeleton provides at this functional level. The researchers believe that high functioning/ limited community ambulators will achieve the highest number of steps and intensity during BWSTT due to the ability to increase challenges via treadmill parameters such as speed and incline while utilizing a harness for safety and bodyweight support only as necessary. In contrast, the researchers believe the amount of BWS and assistance a PT must provide relative to the patient's contribution to practice successful stepping during BWSTT will result in a lower intensity and number of steps achieved in low functioning/household ambulators."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury"],"keywords":["Stroke","Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury","Gait Rehabilitation","Exoskeleton","Balance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Inpatients Post-stroke, low level ambulators","description":"Individuals post acute or subacute stroke that that are inpatients at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab ages 18-75 with initial gait speed 0.0-0.39 m/s","interventionNames":["Device: Body-weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT)","Device: EksoNR exoskeleton gait training","Device: Overground gait training"]},{"label":"Inpatients Post-stroke, high level ambulators","description":"Individuals post acute or subacute stroke that that are inpatients at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab ages 18-75 with initial gait speed 0.4-0.79 m/s","interventionNames":["Device: Body-weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT)","Device: EksoNR exoskeleton gait training","Device: Overground gait training"]},{"label":"Inpatients with iSCI, low level ambulators","description":"Individuals post-SCI or subacute that that are inpatients at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab ages 18-75 with initial gait speed 0.0-0.39 m/s","interventionNames":["Device: Body-weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT)","Device: EksoNR exoskeleton gait training","Device: Overground gait training"]},{"label":"Inpatients with iSCI, high level ambulators","description":"Individuals post-SCI or subacute that that are inpatients at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab ages 18-75 with initial gait speed 0.4-0.79 m/s","interventionNames":["Device: Body-weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT)","Device: EksoNR exoskeleton gait training","Device: Overground gait training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Body-weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT)","description":"Walking on a treadmill in a harness with body weight support as needed","armGroupLabels":["Inpatients Post-stroke, high level ambulators","Inpatients Post-stroke, low level ambulators","Inpatients with iSCI, high level ambulators","Inpatients with iSCI, low level ambulators"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"EksoNR exoskeleton gait training","description":"Walking in the EksoNR exoskeleton","armGroupLabels":["Inpatients Post-stroke, high level ambulators","Inpatients Post-stroke, low level ambulators","Inpatients with iSCI, high level ambulators","Inpatients with iSCI, low level ambulators"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Overground gait training","description":"Walking overground in a harness with body weight support as needed","armGroupLabels":["Inpatients Post-stroke, high level ambulators","Inpatients Post-stroke, low level ambulators","Inpatients with iSCI, high level ambulators","Inpatients with iSCI, low level ambulators"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Observation of Step count","description":"The number of steps taken during each session will be measured using activity monitors/pedometers.
