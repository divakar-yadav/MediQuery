TITACIPPI study is a retrospective, single-center observational study conducted from March 01, 2014, to December 31, 2022.","detailedDescription":"ACI and PPI are frequently associated with clinical fluctuations, characterized by recurrent transient more or less regressive stereotyped episodes of focal motor deficits affecting the face, arm, and leg, and finally with a risk of lasting neurological worsening that can lead to definite residual neurological disability. These ischemic strokes (ACI and PPI) are not very sensitive to IVT, thus 26% to 48% will experience neurological aggravation despite the administration of this treatment. Studies in Asia have shown a possible clinical benefit of simultaneous infusion of tirofiban with IVT in patients with ischemic stroke of atheromatous or microatheromatous origin without additional bleeding risk. To date, no studies have tested the efficacy of simultaneous infusion of tirofiban and IVT in the well-defined subgroup of ACI and PPI and a non-Asian population."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Anterior Choroidal Infarction (ACI)","Paramedian Pontine Infarction (IPP)"],"keywords":["anterior choroidal infarction","paramedian pontine
