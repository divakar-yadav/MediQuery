Purpose: The objective of this study was to evaluate incidence of AF in patients who underwent percutaneous PFO closure with serial 24-hours ambulatory ECG (AECG) monitoring during 6 months follow-up. Primary endpoint was incidence of AF on ECG monitoring. Secondary endpoints were clinical outcomes (symptoms, hospitalization from cardiovascular causes, ischemic stroke, or bleeding) up to 6 month follow-up.","detailedDescription":"This is a prospective, bicentric, observational cohort study which will be performed in University hospital center of Montpellier and NÃ®mes The study will include all consecutive patients, admitted for a percutaneous PFO closure after an ischemic stroke (IS) or a transient ischemic attack (TIA) of cryptogenic origin, or after the occurrence of a decompression illness during scuba diving. Patients eligible for the closure of a FOP in prevention of the recurrence of stroke or TIA of cryptogenic origin, was systematically evaluated for exclusion of supraventricular arrhythmia in accordance with international recommendations. This evaluation included a 12-lead ECG as well as an extended electrocardiographic monitoring lasting more than or equal to 24 hours (most frequently, performing a 72-hour ECG Holter). All patients previously has a transesophageal ultrasound (TEE) allowing to retain the diagnosis of PFO, to assess the presence or not of an atrial septum aneurysm (ASA) associated with PFO and to quantify the right to left shunt thanks to a contrast test potentiated by a Valsalva maneuver. Exclusion criteria included interatrial defect with left to right and others indications for PFO closure that cryptogenic stroke or decompression illness. Indication of PFO closure is always validated by a cardio neurological team.\n\nThe primary objective of the study was incidence of AF defined as an irregular rhythm without discernible P waves lasting at least 30 seconds on ECG monitoring during the 6-month follow-up. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the characteristics of the supra-ventricular arrhythmias (delay in onset, duration, recurrent nature), incidence of others arrhythmia, symptoms, and prognostic implications of AF (hospitalization , need of curative anticoagulation, need for cardioversion and occurrence of neurological accident documented by imagery (ischemic stroke or TIA). The investigators also evaluated risk factors for occurrence of arrhythmia.\n\nA total of 100 patients included during 1 year is expected"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Cryptogenic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"occurrence of sustained supra-ventricular arrhythmia","description":"occurrence of sustained supra-ventricular arrhythmia (AF, atrial flutter) during the analysis the 24-hour Holter ECG performed post-intervention","timeFrame":"the 24-hour post-intervention"},{"measure":"occurrence of sustained supra-ventricular arrhythmia","description":"occurrence of sustained supra-ventricular arrhythmia (AF, atrial flutter) during the analysis at 1 month (Holter ECG)","timeFrame":"at 1 month"},{"measure":"occurrence of sustained supra-ventricular arrhythmia","description":"occurrence of sustained supra-ventricular arrhythmia (AF, atrial flutter) during the analysis at 6 month (Holter ECG)","timeFrame":"at 6 month"},{"measure":"occurrence of sustained supra-ventricular arrhythmia","description":"occurrence of sustained supra-ventricular arrhythmia (AF, atrial flutter) during the analysis at 12 month (Holter ECG)","timeFrame":"at 12 month"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"characteristics of these detected arrhythmias","description":"characteristics of these detected arrhythmias : time to onset","timeFrame":"24 hours post-intervention to 12 months"},{"measure":"characteristics of these detected arrhythmias","description":"characteristics of these detected arrhythmias : duration","timeFrame":"24 hours post-intervention to 12 months"},{"measure":"characteristics of these detected arrhythmias","description":"characteristics of these detected arrhythmias : recurrence","timeFrame":"24 hours post-intervention to 12 months"},{"measure":"symptoms related to the arrhythmia episode","description":"symptoms related to the arrhythmia episode","timeFrame":"24 hours post-intervention to 12 months"},{"measure":"hospitalization related to arrhythmia","description":"hospitalization related to arrhythmia","timeFrame":"24 hours post-intervention to 12 months"},{"measure":"occurrence of a neurological accident.","description":"occurrence of a neurological accident.","timeFrame":"24 hours post-intervention to 12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Men or women over the age of 18 to 60\n* Benefiting from the closure of the FOP percutaneously after a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or a TIA (indication validated during a multidisciplinary meeting with neurologists and cardiologists)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Inability to perform a 24h ECG Holter\n* Pregnant or lactating women\n* Vulnerable people","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"60 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patient at least 18 years old, benefiting from percutaneous closure of the FOP after a cryptogenic stroke (indication validated during a multidisciplinary meeting with neurologists and cardiologists)","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Florence Leclercq, MD, PhD","affiliation":"University Hospital, Montpellier","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Uhmontpellier","city":"Montpellier","zip":"34295","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":43.61092,"lon":3.87723}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED","description":"NC"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001281","term":"Atrial Fibrillation"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000001145","term":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4276","name":"Atrial Fibrillation","asFound":"Atrial Fibrillation","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M27260","name":"Foramen Ovale, Patent","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4143","name":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9109","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC16","name":"Diseases and Abnormalities at or Before Birth"}]}},"hasResults":false}
