This may cause people to lose the ability to perceive a side of space. This is called neglect. Having people wear prism glasses (called PA) can reduce neglect symptoms. Researchers want to find out more about how PA, and whether it restores the balance in the brain.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn how prism adaption temporarily changes vision and connections in the brain.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople ages 18 75 with brain damage of the right side of the brain from a stroke or other cause, leading to neglect.\n\nHealthy volunteers ages 18 75.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have 1 3 visits.\n\nParticipants will be screened with a neurological exam. They may also have:\n\nTests of thinking and vision\n\nTests to see which eye and hand they prefer\n\nA pregnancy test\n\nAll participants will:\n\nAnswer questions about their personality, style of thinking, and beliefs.\n\nDo simple tasks on paper or computer\n\nHave magnetic resonance imaging. They will lie on a table that can slide in and out of a cylinder in a strong magnetic field. Participants will lie still or do computer tasks in the scanner.\n\nParticipants may also have:\n\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation. A brief electrical current passes through a wire coil on the scalp. This creates a magnetic pulse that affects brain activity. Participants may be asked to tense certain muscles or perform simple actions or tasks.\n\nPA. They will sit in front of a board and point to a dot on it while they wear prism glasses that shift vision to the left or right....","detailedDescription":"OBJECTIVES:\n\nThe ability to efficiently select information from the environment relies on a balanced interaction between the right and left hemispheres. Hemispatial neglect, most frequently following damage to the right hemisphere, has been hypothesized to result from the breakdown of this interhemispheric balance. There is evidence from transcranial stimulation studies that the breakdown of this interhemispheric balance is reflected in fronto-parietal connectivity. The primary goal of this study is to test whether altering the balance between the left and right hemispheres, with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or prism adaptation (PA), will affect functional connectivity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We will also explore the relationship between the changes in functional connectivity and behavioral performances.\n\nSTUDY POPULATION: Healthy adult volunteers and patients with neglect after a right hemisphere damage.\n\nDESIGN: The study contains three experiments. Experiment 1 is designed to investigate the mechanism of the changes induced by PA in both resting state functional connectivity in neglect patients and healthy volunteers (a two-arm parallel study). Experiment 2 is designed to investigate the mechanism of the changes in resting state functional connectivity induced by lPA, rPA, nPA in healthy volunteers with right dominant eyes and lPA in healthy volunteer with left dominant eye (a four-arm parallel study). Experiment 3 is designed to see if inhibitory rTMS over the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) can influence functional connectivity and visuospatial bias in healthy volunteers (a crossover study).\n\nOUTCOME MEASURES: For all three experiments the primary outcome measure is the change (or difference) in fronto-parietal resting state connectivity between post and pre PA or rTMS procedure. The secondary outcome measures are the changes in visual field representation and in visuo-motor and cognitive behavior accompanying these manipulations."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Normal Physiology","Stroke"],"keywords":["Chronic Stroke","Neglect","Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Visual and Motor Integration","Visual Fields","Natural History"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":74,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Healthy Volunteer","description":"Inclusion Criteria for Healthy Volunteers/Age-matched Controls"},{"label":"Patients","description":"Patients with neglect after a right hemisphere brain lesion"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Experiment 1: The primary outcome measure will be the change in the strength of the fronto-parietal resting state network (RSN) after rPA in neglect patients.","description":"Measurement of Change","timeFrame":"1 week"},{"measure":"Experiments 2: The primary outcome measure will be the change in the strength of the fronto-parietal resting state network (RSN) after rPA or lPA or nPA.","description":"Measurement of change","timeFrame":"1 week"},{"measure":"Experiment 3: The primary outcome measure will be the change in the strength of the fronto-parietal resting state network (RSN) after cTBS over the PPC versus cTBS over the vertex.","description":"Measurement of change","timeFrame":"3 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Experiment 1: The change of preferred center and size in the different region of interest (ROI) in the parietal cortex, and the change in open loop pointing task performances after rPA.","description":"Observation of changeExperiment 1: The change of preferred center (visual field location) and size (visual field extent) (i.e. population receptive field) in the different region of interest (ROI) in the parietal cortex, and the change in open loop pointing task performances after rPA.","timeFrame":"1 week"},{"measure":"Experiments 2: The change of preferred center and sizein the different region of interest (ROI) in the parietal cortex, and the change in open loop pointing task performances after rPA or lPA, or nPA","description":"Observation of changeExperiments 2: The change of preferred center (visual field location) and size (visual field extent) (i.e. population receptive field) in the different region of interest (ROI) in the parietal cortex, and the change in open loop pointing task performances after rPA or lPA, or nPA","timeFrame":"1 week"},{"measure":"Experiments 3: The change in perceptual line bisection performances after r cTBS over PPC or cTBS over the vertex.","description":"Oberservation of change","timeFrame":"1 week"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nInclusion Criteria for all participants:\n\nAll participants must have had a neurological examination by a NINDS physician within the last two years, a clinical MRI within the last year, and be able to read, write and speak English.\n\nExperiment 2 requires 63 healthy volunteers having right dominant eye and 21 volunteers having left dominant eye.
