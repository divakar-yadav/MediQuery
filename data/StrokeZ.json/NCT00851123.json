Still it remains unclear whether the training intensity or restriction of the better arm plays the bigger role. CIMT or mCIMT is usually compared to standard care of lower intensity with no constraint of the better arm, or other treatments that do not focus on functional (task-specific) training for the hemiplegic arm. Bimanual training, implying training of activities requiring use of both arms, may however, be even more effective than mCIMT, provided that the training is of similar intensity. The purposes of this study are:\n\n1. To compare the functional effect of mCIMT to bimanual training of equal intensity in order to examine if one of the treatment approaches is superior to the other regarding the regaining of motor abilities.\n2. Based on fMRI scans of a subgroup of patients, to examine whether cortical reorganization after stroke differs depending on the type of treatment received (mCIMT vs bimanual training).\n3. To examine the rationale for implementing new treatment approaches in primary- and secondary health care, and thereby contribute to improved coordination between specialist and municipal health care systems.\n\nPatients in both groups will participate in a 4 week training program, either mCIMT or bimanual. In both groups cognitive techniques will be used to increase adherence. The patients will be examined when screening, before and after the intervention, and 3 months after completed intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","arm paresis","mCIMT","bimanual training","rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1.
