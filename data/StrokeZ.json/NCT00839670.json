This study will determine if LICITE will lead to similar improvements than the original described method.","detailedDescription":"Constraint-Induced Movement therapy or CI therapy is a rehabilitation method, that has been shown in controlled studies to produce improvements of upper limb motor function in stroke patients. However, in the original method, 6 hours of daily training are requested, which is often impossible to apply in the majority of rehabilitation unit.\n\nThe aim of this trial is to compare the effect of a modified constraint induced therapy (90 minutes of motor training with a physical or occupational therapist and 270 minutes of self-rehabilitation) to the treatment described originally by Taub et al. (360 minutes of motor training with a physical or occupational therapist).\n\nPatients randomly received one of the two treatment and be evaluated pre- post- and 3 months after the intervention ended. The treatment will last two weeks, five days per week. The evaluations will include clinical measure of motor function and functional MRI of the brain. The brain activity will be measure just before and after the intervention with a manual motor task in order to asses brain plasticity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["1- Constraint induced therapy","2- Stroke","3- Upper limb","4- Rehabilitation","5- Motor training","1- First time clinical ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke","2- At least 10° of active wrist extension","3- At least 10° of thumb abduction/ extension","4- At least 10° of extension in at least 2 additional digits","3- Adequate balance while wearing the restraint."]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Modified Therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Light constraint induced therapy"]},{"label":"Standard Therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Standard constraint induced therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Light constraint induced therapy","description":"90 minutes of motor training with a physical or occupational therapist and 270 minutes of self-rehabilitation, 5 days/week/2 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Modified Therapy"],"otherNames":["Modified constraint induced therapy"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Standard constraint induced therapy","description":"360 minutes of motor training with a physical or occupational therapist, 5 days/week/2 weeks","armGroupLabels":["Standard Therapy"],"otherNames":["Constraint induced therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Motor activity log scale","timeFrame":"10 days before inclusion, 10 days and 3 months after treatment achievement"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function test Stroke impact scale Functional MRI HAD scale","timeFrame":"10 days before inclusion, 10 days and 3 months after treatment achievement except for fMRI (no evaluation at 3 month)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Age \\> 18 years\n* First ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke between 2 and 12 months\n* at least 10°of active wrist extension and at least 10° of thumb abduction/ extension, and at least 10° of extension in at least 2 additional digits.\n* adequate balance while wearing the restraint\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Major cognitive impairment\n* Prior stroke\n* Excessive fatigability\n* Severe aphasia\n* MAL score ≥ 2,5\n* Specific exclusion criteria for fMRI ancillary study","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Olivier SIMON, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Service de Médecine Physique et de Réadaptation - Hôpital BICHAT","city":"Paris","state":"Paris Cedex 18","zip":"75877","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.85341,"lon":2.3488}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2405","name":"Hemorrhagic Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
