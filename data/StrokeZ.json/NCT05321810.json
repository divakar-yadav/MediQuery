Patients with a history of ischemic stroke are at high risk of recurrence and require more rigorous management to prevent recurrence. The same is true for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and treatment with anticoagulants reduces the risk of recurrent embolic stroke. However, some patients still suffer from recurrent embolic and/or ischemic stroke even if they are on anticoagulants for secondary prevention. In addition to the recurrent stroke, risk of bleeding is also higher in the patients with a history of stroke because they are often chronically treated with antiplatelet agents to prevent recurrence after cerebral infarction and with an anticoagulant after embolic stroke. Concomitant use of anticoagulant and anti-platelet agents is sometimes necessary if patients with AF experience cerebral infarction and the risk of bleedings largely enhances in these patients. Thus, patients in secondary prevention are at higher risk of both recurrent ischemic stroke and more effective and safer antithrombotic therapy should take this into account.\n\nThe purpose of this study are 1) to characterize the primary and secondary prevention patients, 2) to calculate incidence rates of stroke/SE or major bleeding in each cohort and 3) to investigate for Japanese secondary prevention patients as RWE on the effectiveness and safety of apixaban compared to warfarin in patients NVAF."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Non-valvular atrial fibrillation","Stroke","Apixaban","Warfarin","Secondary prevention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":193565,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Warfarin cohort (Reference)","description":"Patients with NVAF treated with warfarin","interventionNames":["Drug: Warfarin"]},{"label":"Apixaban cohort","description":"Patients with NVAF treated with apixaban","interventionNames":["Drug: Apixaban"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Apixaban","description":"This is observational study and the patients in the apixaban cohort include those who are exposed to apixaban in the real world settings.","armGroupLabels":["Apixaban cohort"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Warfarin","description":"This is observational study and the patients in the warfarin cohort include those who are exposed to warfarin in the real world settings.","armGroupLabels":["Warfarin cohort (Reference)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence Rate of a Composite of Recurrent Stroke or Systemic Embolism (SE) During the Follow-up Period: Secondary Prevention (Balanced) Cohort","description":"Incidence rate was reported as events per 1,000 participant-years.
