CD34+ stem cells will then be isolated and harvested during a process of immuno-selection in accordance with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice. The CD34+ cells will then be directly infused into the area of the stroke intra-arterially using the middle cerebral artery.\n\nInitially, the investigator will monitor each patient for a period of 6 months post-stem cell infusion. Thereafter, they will revert to their previous treatment regime in the clinic.\n\nAssessment of adverse events will be by physical examination and measurement of laboratory parameters. Assessment of efficacy will be by physical examination and the measurement of laboratory, CT and MRI parameters."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute","Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery"],"keywords":["Stroke","Middle Cerebral Artery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CD34+ stem/progenitor cell therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients presenting within 7 days of onset with severe anterior circulation ischemic stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale \\[NIHSS\\] scoreâ‰¥8).
