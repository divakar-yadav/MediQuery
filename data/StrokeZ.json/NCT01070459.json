The etiologies of which are assigned to physiologic changes in paretic muscle, gait deficits and disability-related deconditioning. This declares that stroke patients live an inactive lifestyle and therefore stay cardiovascular risk patients.\n\nThe usefulness of aerobic training on aerobic capacity is recently been proved in clinical stroke research. However, no study can shown the long-term effect of aerobic exercises. Also the effect of aerobic exercises on daily functioning, fatigue and depression in stroke needs to be established."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Stroke aerobic exercise daily functioning rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"The patients continue their regular therapy in the rehabilitation center.
