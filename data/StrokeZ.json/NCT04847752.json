Detailed clinical data in emergency room and in-hospital will be obtained from the medical record reviews, and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score will be done by certified neurologists to assess the severity of the disease in acute stage and treatment outcome during the follow-up. All cases will undergo routine blood tests, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebral vascular examination, such as TCD, CTA, HRMR or DSA. The investigators will analyze the in-hospital factors that could predict the outcome to provide more evidence-based suggestions in the treatment and prognosis of atherosclerotic ischemic cerebrovascular disease.","detailedDescription":"The detaited information about this trial is described below\n\n1. Quality assurance: The research proposal is reviewed by an Independent Research Panel. If the proposal is approved, access to the study data is provided in a secure data sharing environment after receipt of a signed Data Sharing Agreement.\n2. Data check: Researchers must submit a proposal to conduct a scientifically relevant analysis of the study data.\n3.

Sample size assessment: About 1000 cases.\n7. Plan for missing data: The number of lost cases will be treated as the deleted value and the lost rate will be indicated. Complete sample intentionality analysis and intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis would be performed on the end points. During the analysis, if there is a statistical difference in the results, the number of participants lost in the exposed group will be deleted, and the number of participants lost to in the non-exposed group will be added. If there is still a statistical difference in the results, the loss of follow-up will not have an impact on the analysis results of this group.\n8. Statistical analysis: All statistical data would be analyzed by the SPSS Software 24.0 version. Continuous variables would be reported as median (range, minimum-maximum), which would be compared by Mann-Whitney test, and categorical data would be represented as percentages and frequencies, which would be compared by the two-tailed Fisher's exact test or one-way ANOVA. P\\<0.05 would be considered statistically significant."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Large-Artery Atherosclerosis (Embolus/Thrombosis)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"carotid plaque fixed tissues and plasma"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"carotid artery stenting","description":"common treatments for carotid artery stenosis","otherNames":["CAS"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"carotid endarterectomy","description":"common treatments for carotid artery stenosis","otherNames":["CEA"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aspirin","description":"the dosage and duration","otherNames":["ASP"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Clopidogrel","description":"the dosage and duration","otherNames":["plavix"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Anticoagulant","description":"the dosage and duration","otherNames":["warfarin","rivaroxaban","dabigatran","any other anticoagulant therapy"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Statin","description":"the dosage and duration","otherNames":["atorvastatin","rosuvastatin","any other statin drugs"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"PCSK9 inhibitor","description":"the dosage and duration","otherNames":["Evolocumab","Alirocumab","any other PCSK9 inhibitors"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"all-cause mortality","description":"Death during the follow-up in every single reason","timeFrame":"3-6 months after onset."},{"measure":"Stroke of any kind","description":"Brain CT or MRI scans will be used to measure whether there is any kind of stroke, including TIA, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhage","timeFrame":"3-6 months after onset."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rehospitalization","description":"The rehospitalized times of any circumstances except for admission to hospital only for examination per year will be used to measure the situation","timeFrame":"1 month to 24 months after onset."},{"measure":"National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS score)","description":"The minimum value is 0, and maximum value is 42, and higher scores mean a worse outcome.","timeFrame":"1 month to 24 months after onset."},{"measure":"modified Ranking score (mRS)","description":"The minimum value is 0, and maximum value is 6, and higher scores mean a worse outcome.","timeFrame":"1 month to 24 months after onset."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Ischemic stroke due to large-artery atherosclerosis has been proved by clinical symptoms and imaging examinations.\n* Symptomatic superior arch stenosis \\>50%\n* Asymptomatic superior arch stenosis was \\>70%\n* written informed consent was obtained from patients or their surrogates before enrollment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Brain CT or MRI showing cerebral hemorrhage (excluded ischemic stroke with hemorrhage transformation)\n* With severe systemic disease, are expected to survive \\< 3 months\n* Patients will not able to provide continuous follow-up information","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with ischemic stroke due to large-artery atherosclerosis admission to Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology from March 1, 2021 - December 31, 2026","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Dai-Shi Tian, Dr.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"86-27-83663337","email":"tiands@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn"},{"name":"Chuan Qin, Dr.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"86-27-83663337","email":"qinchuan712@126.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Dai-Shi Tian, Dr.","affiliation":"Tongji Hospital","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"},{"name":"Chuan Qin, Dr.","affiliation":"Tongji Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Jun Xiao, Dr.","affiliation":"Tongji Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Ke Shang, Dr.","affiliation":"Tongji Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Wuhan","zip":"430030","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Dai-shi Tian, Dr","role":"CONTACT","phone":"86-27-83663337","email":"tiands@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":30.58333,"lon":114.26667}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"YES","description":"all IPD that underlie results in a publication","infoTypes":["STUDY_PROTOCOL","SAP"],"timeFrame":"starting 12 months after publication","accessCriteria":"Researchers must submit a proposal to conduct a scientifically relevant analysis of the study data.
