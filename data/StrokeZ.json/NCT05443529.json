The study is cross-sectional, participants with stroke will be recruited and divided into two groups: the first group composed of individuals with stroke who regularly participate in adaptive sports; and the second of individuals with stroke who do not regularly participate in adaptive sports. The two groups will have to be similar in terms of demographic variables (age, gender, time since beginning of stroke). A series of parameters will be tested, on one occasion for each participant. The two groups will then be compared to one another."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Adaptive sports group","description":"Individuals with stroke who regularly, and on a long-term basis, participate in adaptive sports","interventionNames":["Other: Adaptive sports"]},{"label":"Non adaptive sports group","description":"Individuals with stroke who do not engage in adaptive sports"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Adaptive sports","description":"Participation in community adaptive sports programs","armGroupLabels":["Adaptive sports group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional walking","description":"Measured through a 6 minute-walk test where participants walk back and forth from one cone to another (placed 30 meters away), during 6 minutes.
