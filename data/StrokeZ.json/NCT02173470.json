This may crush aortic calcifications causing them to embolize to the brain causing a stroke which is a devastating complication for the patient. A chest X-ray is routinely performed prior to heart surgery. It provides no information about aortic calcification. Imaging by a chest computed tomography (CT) scan provides detailed information on aortic calcification but has higher radiation exposure and thus is not used routinely. Recently iterative reconstruction (IR) techniques have become available that allow chest CT to be performed at markedly reduced dose with retained image quality. Routine use of low dose chest CT with IR prior to heart surgery may identify patients with a severely calcified aorta in which the surgery may subsequently adapted to minimize or avoid aortic manipulation which may reduce stroke rate.\n\nIn this multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial the effect of preoperative chest CT on postoperative stroke is investigated. In total 1724 patients will be included of whom 862 patients will receive an additional CT to standard care and 862 patients will receive routine care."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiac Defects","Disorder; Heart, Functional, Postoperative, Cardiac Surgery","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":866,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Routine clinical care (which includes a conventional chest X-ray)."},{"label":"CT scan","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Routine clinical care, which includes a chest x-ray, with an additional ultra low-dose non contrast enhanced chest CT with IR (performed preoperatively).","interventionNames":["Other: CT scan"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"CT scan","description":"The intervention group receives both standard care (chest x-ray) and an ultra low dose CT thorax without contrast.","armGroupLabels":["CT scan"],"otherNames":["computed tomography"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Postoperative stroke","description":"Percentage of patients suffering from in-hospital postoperative stroke (central neurological defect that either recovers spontaneously or is permanent) after heart surgery.","timeFrame":"Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 5 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Altered surgical approach","description":"Percentage of patients in which the surgical approach is altered based on information derived from the preoperative chest CT.","timeFrame":"The surgery will take place the day after hospital administration."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 18 years old or older\n* Scheduled to undergo heart surgery\n* Provide written informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient not meeting inclusion criteria\n* Pregnant women\n* Scheduled to undergo transcatheter aortic valve insertion procedure (since these patients receive a standard preoperative CT)\n* Chest or cardiac CT in the past three months\n* Emergency surgery\n* Concomitant or previous participation in a study that prohibits the patient from participating in a study that exposed the patient to radiation\n* Unwillingness to be informed about unrequested findings on the CT scan","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Ricardo PJ Budde, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Erasmus MC Rotterdam","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Heart and Vascular Center Semmelweis University","city":"Budapest","country":"Hungary","geoPoint":{"lat":47.49801,"lon":19.03991}},{"facility":"Erasmus Medical Center","city":"Rotterdam","country":"Netherlands","geoPoint":{"lat":51.9225,"lon":4.47917}},{"facility":"University Medical Center Utrecht","city":"Utrecht","zip":"3508GA","country":"Netherlands","geoPoint":{"lat":52.09083,"lon":5.12222}}]},"referencesModule":{"availIpds":[{"type":"Study Protocol","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26857421","comment":"Ultra low-dose chest ct with iterative reconstructions as an alternative to conventional chest x-ray prior to heart surgery (CRICKET study): Rationale and design of a multicenter randomized trial."}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
