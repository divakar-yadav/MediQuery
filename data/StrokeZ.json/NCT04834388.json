Treatment options are very limited. Inflammation plays a vital role in the development of sICH-related secondary brain injury (SBI). Within 4 hours after sICH onset, blood components and thrombin induce the release of cytokines and other inflammatory molecules, with subsequent microglial activation, blood brain barrier (BBB) damage and the formation of perihaematomal oedema (PHO). Among the released cytokines, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) has a pivotal role. Recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra, anakinra) effectively antagonizes IL-1β through competitive binding to the IL-1 receptor. Anakinra is available for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, other inflammatory diseases and has been studied in acute sepsis. We hypothesize that anakinra safely reduces SBI after sICH, and that its effect is dose-dependent.\n\nObjective: To determine the effect of high-dose versus low-dose anakinra compared to standard medical management on oedema extension distance (OED) determined with MRI on day 7±1. Second, to study the safety profile of anakinra. Furthermore, to assess its effect on 1) serum inflammatory markers IL-1β, IL-6, hsCRP, neutrophil and total white blood cell counts at day 1, 3 and 7 compared to baseline; 2) DCE-MRI measurement of BBB transfer constant (Ktrans) on day 7±1, and; 3) to estimate an effect on functional outcome in patients with sICH.\n\nStudy design: Multicentre, prospective, randomized, three-armed (1:1:1) trial with open label treatment and blinded end-point assessment (PROBE design) .\n\nStudy population: 75 patients with supratentorial sICH admitted within 8 hours after symptom onset.\n\nIntervention: Patients will receive anakinra in either a high dose (loading dose 500mg i.v., followed by infusion with 2mg/kg/h over 3 days; n=25) or in a low dose (loading dose 100mg s.c.., followed by subcutaneous administration of 100mg twice a day for 3 days; n=25), started within 8 hours of symptom onset. The control group (n=25) will receive standard medical management.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: Primary objective is to test whether anakinra reduces subacute perihaematomal oedema after sICH, measured as OED on MRI at day 7±1."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"PROBE design","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":75,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Anakinra High dose","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"500mg i.v. loading dose, followed by continuous iv infusion with 2mg/kg/h over 3 days","interventionNames":["Drug: Anakinra"]},{"label":"Anakinra Low dose","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"100mg s.c. loading dose, followed by subcuteanous administration of 100mg twice daily for 3 days.","interventionNames":["Drug: Anakinra"]},{"label":"Standard care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Standard care group"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Anakinra","description":"Anakinra treatment is started within 8 hours of symptom onset","armGroupLabels":["Anakinra High dose","Anakinra Low dose"],"otherNames":["Kineret"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Perihematomal oedema","description":"Measured as Oedema Extension Distance (OED/EED)","timeFrame":"7 days after ICH onset"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Adverse events of special interest (AESI) and serious adverse events (SAE)","timeFrame":"90 days"},{"measure":"Blood brain barriere leakage","description":"Measured as Ktrans on DCE-MRI","timeFrame":"7 days"},{"measure":"Levels of serum inflammatory markers","description":"IL-1β, IL-6, hsCRP, neutrophil and total white blood cell counts","timeFrame":"7 days"},{"measure":"Functional outcome","description":"Ordinal shift in functional outcome (comparing the intervention group to the controls), assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months.
