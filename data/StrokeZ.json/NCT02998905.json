Recruitment will occur at 10 high-volume stroke research centres across Canada over 2 years, at which 100 adult patients with high-risk atrial fibrillation (CHADS2 ≥2) and previous spontaneous or traumatic ICH (intraparenchymal or intraventricular hemorrhage while on or off anticoagulation) will be randomly assigned to receive a NOAC (particular agent at the discretion of the local investigator) or ASA 81 mg per day. Patients will be followed for a mean of 1 year to a common end-study date. The feasibility of recruitment will also be tested. The investigators estimate that five patients per year per centre can be recruited."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Intracerebral Hemorrhage"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"NOAC","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Apixaban or dabigatran or edoxaban or rivaroxaban","interventionNames":["Drug: NOAC"]},{"label":"Acetylsalicylic Acid","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Acetylsalicylic acid","interventionNames":["Drug: Acetylsalicylic Acid"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"NOAC","description":"Apixaban or dabigatran or edoxaban or rivaroxaban at recommended dosing for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.
