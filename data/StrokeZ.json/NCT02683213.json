Data will be unblinded when the 6-months follow-up is completed, and the primary outcome is due to report on May 2020.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is a serious, life-threatening medical condition that happens when the blood supply to a part of the brain is cut off, usually due to a blood clot (ischemic) or hemorrhage. Symptoms vary according to how much of the brain is affected and where in the brain the stroke occurs but includes paralysis, muscle weakness and speech problems.\n\nA stroke can also have an impact on the sufferers emotions and can lead to anxiety, depression and personality changes. Fluoxetine (otherwise known as Prozac) has been used for many years to treat depression. However, there is evidence to suggest that it may also have other effects of the brain and enhance brain plasticity (the reorganisation of neural pathways in the brain) in a number of different ways.\n\nOne small study, for example, has shown that, if taken soon after a stroke, fluoxetine might improve the recovery of arm strength and lead to greater restoration of movement of the limbs.\n\nAdult participants (at least 18 years old) who have had a stroke (either ischemic or hemorrhagic) within the last 2-15 days and still have some residual problems caused by the stroke e.g. weakness, or problems with their speech (speech impairment).\n\nParticipants are randomly allocated into one of two groups. Those in group 1 are given fluoxetine capsules for 6 months. Those in group 2 are given a placebo capsules for 6 months.\n\nThe participants are contacted after one week of starting their treatment, and then again after one month, to check on their well-being and that they are still taking their allocated caplets. Each participant is asked about any side effects and how much training they have had with e.g. a physiotherapist, occupational- or speech-therapist.\n\nThe research team contacts each participant at 3 months to check whether they are still taking the capsules, ask about bad side effects, and about how they are feeling (mood). If all is well, the participant is given enough medication to cover the rest of the study period.\n\nThe participant is asked to stop the study medication after 6 months and repeat assessments that they did before they started the study at the local hospital. They are also asked to fill in questionnaires together with their next of kin or carer. These questionnaires are sent to the trial main centre. If needed, they can also be filled in with the help of a trial nurse over the telephone.\n\nThe participants are contacted again one month after they have stopped the medication to see how they have progressed.\n\nAt 12 months after recruitment, participants are asked to complete the same questionnaires again about how well they have recovered from their stroke and what problems they now have after the stroke e.g. weakness in limbs, memory problems, problems with speech, low mood. These questionnaires can again be completed on paper or by telephone. The researchers then collect data on long-term recovery through national statistics."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["fluoxetine","outcome","depression","plasticity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1500,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Fluoxetine","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"One capsule Fluoxetine 20mg once daily for 6 months.","interventionNames":["Drug: Fluoxetine"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"One matching capsule placebo once daily for 6 months.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Fluoxetine","description":"Fluoxetine 20mg once daily for 6 months.","armGroupLabels":["Fluoxetine"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Matching placebo.","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional status, measured with the modified Rankin scale.","description":"The simple modified Rankin scale questionnaire delivered by postal questionnaire, or via interview over the telephone or face to face to determine the modified Rankin scale.","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Survival","description":"Survival will be analysed with the Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for the factors included in the minimisation algorithm","timeFrame":"This will be determined by following patients up for 12 months."},{"measure":"Functional status, measured with the modified Rankin scale.","description":"The simple modified Rankin scale questionnaire delivered by postal questionnaire, or via interview over the telephone or face to face to determine the modified Rankin scale.
