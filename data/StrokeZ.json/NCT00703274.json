PROTECT DC is a program consisting of in-hospital education coupled with community-based \"stroke navigators\" and is designed to reduce the rate of vascular events or death in a population of underserved individuals with stroke.","detailedDescription":"Despite significant advances in the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in the last few decades, stroke remains the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the United States. For the population that has experienced a cerebrovascular event, the risk of future stroke is greatly increased. The initiation of effective secondary prevention strategies is most effective when implemented early (before disabling stroke occurs), monitored frequently, and maintained long-term after a cerebrovascular event.\n\nThe Preventing Recurrence of Thromboembolic Events through Coordinated Treatment in the District of Columbia (PROTECT DC) intervention uses stroke navigators to help people who have suffered a stroke implement secondary prevention strategies. Stroke navigators are lay persons trained to provide education on secondary prevention behavior, and trained to navigate the health and human service system. The goals are to help individuals who have had a stroke obtain the necessary services and programs to engage in secondary prevention behaviors and, ultimately, to prevent the recurrence of stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","stroke","cerebrovascular stroke","cerebrovascular accident","CVA","community health services","community health workers","navigators","health education","barriers to care","healthcare access","healthcare disparities"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":230,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Navigation Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants enrolled in this group will receive education concerning primary and secondary PROTECT DC goals.
