The association of the sleep respiratory troubles with a reserved functional prognosis is debated. The purpose is to find out the frequency of the sleep respiratory troubles after stroke in a PRM department and to study their relationship with functional and neurological recovery.\n\nForty-five patients with the average of 58,2 years had been included in this prospective MONOCENTRICAL study. The detection of the sleep respiratory troubles was realised using a nocturnal oxymetry device and measuring the inspiratory flow, gathering the index of apnea-hypopnea.\n\nThe NIHSS, the FIM and the FUGL-MEYER scales were used at the moment of inclusion and two months AFTERWORDS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sleep Apnea, Obstructive"],"keywords":["Sleep apnea","NIHSS scale","FIM scale","FUGL-MEYER scale"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"With sleep APNEA","description":"Sleeping Apnea Syndrome (SAS) screening usin an APNEA LINK device within the 10 first days following the admission Diagnosis and medical care by a sleeping disorder qualified specialist"},{"label":"Without sleep APNEA","description":"Sleeping Apnea Syndrome (SAS) screening usin an APNEA LINK device within the 10 first days following the admission"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"the variation of the FIM (Functional Independence Measure)","description":"defined by the FIM score after 2 months minus the FIM score at the initial moment(T0)","timeFrame":"at 2 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"age","timeFrame":"at inclusion"},{"measure":"BMI (Body Mass Index)","timeFrame":"at inclusion"},{"measure":"Score NIHSS (National Institute of Health Stroke Score)","description":"Comparison between inclusion and 2 months","timeFrame":"at 2 months"},{"measure":"Fugl Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery after Stroke","description":"comparison between inclusion and 2 months","timeFrame":"at 2 months"},{"measure":"Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)","timeFrame":"at inclusion"},{"measure":"Attention tests","description":"BAWL Test (Batterie Attentionnelle William Lennox)","timeFrame":"at inclusion"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nPatient's or one family member's agreement for participation in the study Being aged over 18 years Stroke history in the past 6 months (ischemic or hemorrhagic) Hospitalisation in PRM department and participation to a rehabilitation program during study Patient belonging to the social security system\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPatient having a sleep apnea syndrome known prior to inclusion Patient presenting a cardiorespiratory INSUFIENCY Patients being INABLE to carry-out the tests or presenting a mental disorder Patients who started already their rehabilitation program before in another PRM center or department","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with stroke history in the past 6 months (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and Hospitalisation in PRM department and participation to a rehabilitation program during study","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Alain YELNIK, MD,PhD","affiliation":"Assistance Publique -
