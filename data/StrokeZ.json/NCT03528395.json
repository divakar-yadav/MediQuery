The patient must get up from a chair, walk three meters in a straight line, turn and return to sit in the chair. The valuation is quantified from 1 to 5: 1- normal, and 5- fall hazard during the test. At present study was conducted supervised by two people that were placed laterally to the patient.","timeFrame":"eight weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Tinetti scale","description":"Scale validated in the context of stroke and whose score maximum for balance is 16 points, and 12 for gait. The higher the score, the lower risk of falls (less than 19 points on the scale total implies a high risk of falls; the risk is moderate with scores of 19 to 24).","timeFrame":"eight weeks"},{"measure":"Baropodometry","description":"The T-plate ® pedometer provides information on the pressure exerted by each point of the sole of the foot, distribution and plantar symmetry through a static test in the standing position. This test registers the center of pressures at a given moment, offering information on the distribution load (%) and the support surface.","timeFrame":"eight weeks"},{"measure":"Static Posturography","description":"Postural and static balance in standing was assessed through lateral and anteroposterior movement of the center of pressures in the x and y axes, in centimeters and square centimeters. Tests carried out were the Romberg test with open eyes, in which the patient remains on the platform and try to maintain balance during 30 seconds, and the Romberg test with eyes closed, in which the patient remains on the platform with closed eyes and tries to keep their balance for 30 seconds.","timeFrame":"eight weeks"},{"measure":"Functional reach test","description":"This test was used to detect alterations of the postural control and balance. The patient is placed standing holding the arm with the shoulder at 90 ° flexion, with a clenched fist, then realizes a maximum anterior reach without moving the feet of the ground. The maximum forwards distance without any supports is measured. A rigid tape measure with a leveler was used of a rule and bubble level calibrated bubble adhered to a mirror located on the wall. Patients able to perform this test were located with the healthy side next to the mirror, without direct contact. The result is registered in centimeters, measuring the distance between the initial and final position.","timeFrame":"eight weeks"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin scale","description":"Assesses the degree of physical disability after a stroke assigning a subjective score from 1 to 5. It is a very useful tool, validated and translated, to categorize functional level. It was used as a valuation tool pre and post intervention to describe changes in the level of functional independence of the patient after the experimental intervention.","timeFrame":"eight weeks"},{"measure":"Barthel index","description":"In order to assess functional independence, the Barthel index, indicated to evaluate the activities of daily life and validated in the Stroke context, translated and adapted to Spanish. It consists of 10 items with a range of score between 0 and 100 (with lower score, greater dependency).","timeFrame":"eight weeks"},{"measure":"EQ-5D Questionnaire","description":"The quality of life related to health was evaluated through the EuroQoL 5D. It is a test self-administered, generic, adapted to Spanish, in which health status is assessed in five dimensions (mobility, personal care, activities daily, pain / discomfort and anxiety / depression), and includes an optimal visual analog scale to assess the state of health at the time of registration (0-100).","timeFrame":"eight weeks"},{"measure":"Cano-Mañas scale","description":"The level of motivation, self-esteem and adherence to intervention was assessed using the Cano- Mañas. It is a Likert scale prepared by the research team and made since there is no validated instrument and translated that met the specific needs required. The first week of intervention was administered experimental and at the end of the eight weeks. It included 16 items (five motivation items, five of self-esteem and six of adhesion to the intervention).
