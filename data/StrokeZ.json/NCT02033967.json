This procedure is conventionally guided by monitoring the central venous pressure (CVP). Stroke volume variation (SVV) is a novel method to substitute with CVP to monitor cardiac preload. The investigators try to evaluate the relationship between CVP and SVV during CVP-guided vasodilator induced hypovolemia (validation study). Then, feasibility of vasodilator induced hypovolemia using the SVV calculated from the validation study will be tested (feasibility study).","detailedDescription":"This is a 2-phases study.\n\nfirst phase validation study : Evaluation of the relationship between CVP and SVV during CVP-guided vasodilator induced hypovolemia\n\nsecond phase feasibility study\n\n: Comparison of the surgical field grade between validation study group(CVP guided group) and feasibility study group(SVV guided group)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["CVP and SVV During Living Donor Hepatectomy","Surgical Field Grade (Condition of Surgical Field; Bleeding, Tension of the IVC)"],"keywords":["liver donor","hepatectomy","vasodilator","central venous pressure","stroke volume variation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":54,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CVP","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Central venous pressure-guided vasodilator-induced hypovolemia","interventionNames":["Procedure: vasodilator induced hypovolemia"]},{"label":"SVV","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"stroke volume variation-guided vasodilator-induced hypovolemia","interventionNames":["Procedure: vasodilator induced hypovolemia"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"vasodilator induced hypovolemia","armGroupLabels":["CVP","SVV"],"otherNames":["Milrinone induced hypovolemia"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"target value of SVV","description":"Target value of SVV is calculated from the linear regression equation that was calculated from scatter plot made with CVP and SVV values during CVP-guided vasodilator induced hypovolemia (validation study).","timeFrame":"during living donor hepatectomy"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"surgical field","description":"\\<4 point scale\\> Grade l: Very lax IVC and hepatic veins, minimal bleeding at resection plane, very easy to operate Grade ll: Lax IVC and hepatic veins, a little bleeding at resection plane, easy to operate Grade lll: Tense IVC and hepatic veins, appreciable bleeding at resection plane, somewhat difficult to operate Grade lV: Very tense IVC and hepatic veins, profuse bleeding at resection plane, very difficult to operate","timeFrame":"during living donor hepatectomy"},{"measure":"use of inotropics","timeFrame":"during living donor hepatectomy"},{"measure":"estimated blood loss","timeFrame":"during living donor hepatectomy"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* adult (20-60 yr)\n* elective living liver donors\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* not obtained informed consent","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"60 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Seoul national University Hospital","city":"Seoul","zip":"110-744","country":"Korea, Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":37.566,"lon":126.9784}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"28632543","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Lee J, Kim WH, Ryu HG, Lee HC, Chung EJ, Yang SM, Jung CW.
