Recently, five randomized controlled trials (ANGEL-ASPECT \\[Endovascular Therapy in Acute Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusive Patients with a Large Infarct Core\\], LASTE \\[LArge Stroke Therapy Evaluation\\], RESCUE-Japan LIMIT \\[The Recovery by Endovascular Salvage for Cerebral Ultra-Acute Embolism-Japan Large Ischemic Core Trial\\], SELECT 2 \\[Randomized Controlled Trial to Optimize Patient's Selection for Endovascular Treatment in Acute Ischemic Stroke\\], and TENSION \\[The Efficacy and Safety of Thrombectomy in Stroke with extended lesion and extended time window\\]) demonstrated the efficacy and safety of thrombectomy for large infarct patients (defined as Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score \\[ASPECTS\\] ≥3 or infarct core \\<100ml). Patients with extra-large infarct core (volume greater than 100 mL, ASPECTS score of 2 or less) were excluded from these trials. Therefore, the efficacy of endovascular thrombectomy in patients with extra-large ischemic burden has not been well studied. The XL STROKE registry is aiming to investigate the clinical outcomes and safety of mechanical thrombectomy in acute extra-large ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":600,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Endovascular thrombectomy","description":"Patients in this group will be treated with medical management plus endovascular thrombectomy","interventionNames":["Other: medical management","Other: endovascular thrombectomy"]},{"label":"Medical management","description":"Patients in this group will be treated with medical management alone","interventionNames":["Other: medical management"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"medical management","description":"Medical management includes IV thrombolysis, antiplatelet, and/or anticoagulation.","armGroupLabels":["Endovascular thrombectomy","Medical management"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"endovascular thrombectomy","description":"Endovascular thrombectomy with stent-retriever, local aspiration, angioplasty, and/or stenting.","armGroupLabels":["Endovascular thrombectomy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale score","description":"Modified Rankin scale score (mRS): scores range from 0 to 6, with 0 indicating no disability, 1 no clinically significant disability, 2 slight disability, 3 moderate disability but able to walk unassisted, 4 moderately severe disability, 5 severe disability, and 6 death","timeFrame":"90 days after enrollment"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"independent ambulation (defined as a mRS score of 0-3) at 90 days","description":"Score of 0-3 on the modified Rankin scale","timeFrame":"90 days after enrollment"},{"measure":"Functional independence","description":"Score of 0-2 on the modified Rankin scale","timeFrame":"90 days after enrollment"},{"measure":"Excellent outcome","description":"Score of 0-1 on the modified Rankin scale","timeFrame":"90 days after enrollment"},{"measure":"Incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH)","description":"using Heidelberg criteria to assess SICH","timeFrame":"48 hours after enrollment"},{"measure":"Mortality","description":"Death from any cause","timeFrame":"90 days after enrollment"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nClinical inclusion criteria:\n\n1.
