It is necessary to shift tasks to other healthcare providers who are trained to provide rehabilitation like nurses. The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of a modified Barthel Index based rehabilitation nursing program on acute stroke inpatients.","detailedDescription":"Ischemic stroke is the main cause of disability in the world. More than 70% of stroke patients show various degrees of neural function impairment. Early rehabilitation in acute phase is beneficial for improving patient's activity of daily livings and motor function. However, it is difficult to obtain effective rehabilitation during the acute phase of stroke because of the insufficiency of professional rehabilitation therapists in stroke wards in China. The investigators assume that implementing program based on modified Barthel Index can realize nursing-directed motor rehabilitation during acute phase of ischemic stroke. The present study is to conduct quasi-experimental research to confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of nursing-directed precision rehabilitation in acute stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Nursing"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":104,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Modified Barthel Index-based rehabilitation nursing program","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients received the Modified Barthel Index based rehabilitation nursing from qualified nurses.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: The modified Barthel Index-based rehabilitation nursing program"]},{"label":"Usual care","type":"OTHER","description":"Patients received the usual care.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Usual care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"The modified Barthel Index-based rehabilitation nursing program","description":"The intervention with the program based on the MBI classified function of patients into five levels, with every 20 points as a level, Each level corresponds to different training items.
