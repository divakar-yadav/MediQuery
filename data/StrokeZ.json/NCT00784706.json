To examine the possible improvement in abnormal eye movement after the intervention, the eye movement parameters included the fixation amplitude (the distance between the most left and the most right fixation points), the number of fixation points, and the fixation time in the left area (Left fixation points and Left fixation time). A fixation point is defined as the gaze point stays in 50 pixels on the screen over 30 ms and can be screened by a fixation filter function in the ClearView 2.0. A wider fixation amplitude, larger L fixation points, and longer L fixation time represent the alleviated syndrome of neglect.","timeFrame":"2008-2009"},{"measure":"kinematic variables","description":"Kinematic analysis was used to detect UE and trunk movement. A 7-camera motion-analysis system (VICON MX; Oxford Metrics Inc., Oxford, UK)6 was linked to a personal computer to capture the movement of markers. Reference markers were placed on the seventh cervical vertebra (C7), the fourth thoracic vertebra (T4), the bilateral clavicles, midsternum, and the unaffected side of the acromion, middle of the humerus, lateral epicondyle,styloid process of the ulna and radius, and index nail. Kinematic variables included reaction time (second), normalized movement time (second), normalized total distance (mm), percentage of movement time where peak velocity (PPV) occurs, and trunk lateral shift.","timeFrame":"2008-2009"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* a clinical cerebrovascular of right cerebral accident patients\n* the age over 18-year-old\n* demonstration of Brunnstrom stage III of the affected upper extremity\n* patients with perceptual deficits\n* no severe cognitive disorder, could understand and follow orders\n* no severe equilibrium problems which will influence the intervention\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* recurrent of the stroke or epilepsy during the intervention\n* patients with the neurological or psychical history, for example, alcoholism, drug poisoning or bipolar disorder\n* injected the Botox into the affected upper extremity during the past 6 months\n* participate in the other interventional study in the same time\n* refuse subscribed the informed consent","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Ching-yi Wu, ScD","affiliation":"Department of Occupational Therapy, Chang Gung Univ.","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Chang Gung Memorial Hospital","city":"Kwei-shan, Toayuan county","country":"Taiwan"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M16045","name":"Syndrome","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
