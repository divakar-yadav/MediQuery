The cerebral saturation was monitored intraoperatively with near infrared spectroscopy (INVOS 4100; Somanetics Inc, Troy, MI).

A lead for the cerebral saturation monitoring was placed on degreased skin on the patient's forehead, on the right side, some 1 cm over the eyebrow. The baseline value was determined before induction of anaesthesia. The following criteria were accepted as significant reduction of the cerebral oxygenation (saturation) value: reduction of the cerebral oxymetry by over 25% in relation to the baseline; the absolute value of cerebral oxymetry below 50%."},{"label":"cognitive function","description":"Upon the day preceding the actual surgery, and again at 5 days after the surgery, the Mini Mental State Examination test was completed, with a view to assessing the chang-es in the patients' cognitive function.
