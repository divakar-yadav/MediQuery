The investigator will evaluate the patient's level of consciousness using The Glasgow Coma Scale, intensity of cognitive disorders using The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (МоСА), condition using National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and The Modified Rankin Scale (mRs). Concomitant therapy will be recorded and changes in cerebral CT/MRI will be evaluated. If the subject meets inclusion criteria and has no exclusion criteria, he/she will be randomized to MMH-MAP or Placebo group. The first dose of the study product should be taken within 72 hours post stroke debut.\n\nAt Visit 2 (day 12±3, end of hospitalization period - the last day of hospitalization due to the current stroke) complaints will be collected, objective examination findings will be recorded, monitoring of the prescribed and concomitant therapy will be performed, treatment safety, compliance and stroke severity according to NIHSS will be evaluated.\n\nBy the end of hospital therapy the subject will be switched to outpatient therapy with continuation of IMP and medical assistance designed for the treatment of stroke and its sequelae.\n\nAt Visit 3 (day 45±7 days) the investigator will make a phone call to the subject evaluating the treatment safety.\n\nAt final Visit 4 (day 90±7 days) complaints will be collected, objective examination findings will be recorded, monitoring of the prescribed and concomitant therapy will be performed, treatment safety, compliance, condition according to NIHSS will be evaluated, mRs, Clinical Global Impression Efficacy Index (CGI-EI) will be filled. The investigator will perform MoCA testing. Safety laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis) will be carried out.\n\nThroughout the study the patient will receive the treatment approved by the decree of the RF Ministry of Health dated 29.12.2012 No. 740n \"On approval of standard of special care in cerebral infarction\" except for the products specified in section \"Forbidden concomitant therapy\"."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cognitive Disorders"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":246,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MMH-MAP","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Oral administration. 2 tablets twice daily (approximately at the same time).
