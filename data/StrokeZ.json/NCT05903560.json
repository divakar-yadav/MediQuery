Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is commonly caused by cerebrovascular stenosis or occlusion. The most effective treatment for AIS is timely and successful angiographic reperfusion.\n\nDue to the large diameter and obvious positioning of bilateral femoral arteries, the transfemoral artery (TFA) using Seldinger's technique has been the most commonly used approach for endovascular treatment. However, recent studies have suggested that the radial artery is an ideal puncture site for cerebrovascular intervention. Small sample studies have confirmed that endovascular recanalization for acute anterior circulation large vessel occlusion via TRA has been safe and effective. Still, there are some complex approaches needed to be converted to TFA. There has been no difference in total operation duration and fluoroscopy time between TRA and TFA, but the TRA group had higher radiation dose and shorter hospital stays than the TFA group. In addition, TRA tends to be more convenient than TFA, especially for posterior circulation lesions.\n\nHowever, the current studies are based on a single center with a small sample size, and there has been still a lack of large-sample randomized controlled experiments to verify the safety and effectiveness of posterior endovascular recanalization via TRA."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":386,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"the radial group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with basilar artery occlusion within 24 hours of onset will be chosen to receive endovascular recanalization via radial approach randomly","interventionNames":["Procedure: endovascular recanalization via radial approach"]},{"label":"the femoral group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients with basilar artery occlusion within 24 hours of onset will be chosen to receive endovascular recanalization via femoral approach randomly","interventionNames":["Procedure: endovascular recanalization via femoral approach"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"endovascular recanalization via radial approach","description":"Patients with basilar artery occlusion within 24 hours of onset will be chosen to receive endovascular recanalization via radial approach","armGroupLabels":["the radial group"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"endovascular recanalization via femoral approach","description":"Patients with basilar artery occlusion within 24 hours of onset will be chosen to receive endovascular recanalization via femoral approach","armGroupLabels":["the femoral group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"favorable neurological function","description":"favorable neurological function (defined as mRS score ≤ 3)","timeFrame":"at 90 days post-operation"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Procedure time","description":"Procedure time of the endovascular thrombectomy","timeFrame":"at the operation 1 day"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
