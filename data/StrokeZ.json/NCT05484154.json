During a lead-in dose-finding phase, a maximum of 360 subjects will be randomized to 3K3A-APC or placebo using a Bayesian adaptive approach. Randomized subjects will receive 3K3A-APC or placebo every 12 hours for up to 5 doses (approximately 3 days) or until discharge from the hospital (whichever occurs first). The lead-in phase will transition to one selected 3K3A APC dose-and recruitment will continue-when a single dose proves superior to all other doses and safe.\n\nThe definitive phase will continue with the selected dose of 3K3A-APC from the lead-in phase. Randomization will be stratified on 4 variables. Lead-in patients who received the dose selected for the definitive phase will be included in the final data analysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic
