ALD-401 is made from the stroke patient's bone marrow and infused 13-19 days after the stroke.","detailedDescription":"This is a randomized, sham-controlled, multi-center, parallel-group, study in male and female subjects, designed to determine the safety and efficacy of ALD-401 in treating primary ischemic stroke. Approximately 100 subjects will be randomized 3:2 within a site to the treatment or sham control arm. Subjects experiencing an ischemic stroke will undergo either a bone marrow or a sham harvest on days 11-17 and be dosed with ALD-401 or a sham procedure 13-19 days after the primary event. Bone marrow cells are processed, sorted and formulated into a 3 mL suspension of ALD-401. Two days after harvest, subjects in the ALD-401 group will have their processed bone marrow cells (ALD-401) injected via intracarotid/MCA infusion, while control subjects have a sham infusion. All subjects will be followed for 12 months to monitor safety and to assess mental and physical function.\n\nThis study seeks to demonstrate safety of ALD-401 derived from autologous bone marrow and given via intracarotid delivery in a therapeutic window of 13-19 days post primary stroke event. This dosing window was selected to allow post-stroke inflammatory response to recede and therefore minimize the impact of resident inflammatory cells on the administration of ALD-401. This dosing window was consistent with information derived from pre-clinical models. Intracarotid/MCA delivery may offer minimal loss or dilution of therapeutic cells prior to localization in and around the ischemic area of the brain. ALD-401 will be manufactured from the patient's own bone marrow harvested 11-17 days after the primary stroke event."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Ischemic Stroke","Stroke in Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA)"],"keywords":["Stroke","Ischemia","Ischemic Stroke","Middle Cerebral Artery","MCA","Stem Cells","Stem Cell","Autologous Bone Marrow","Ipsilateral MCA"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ALD-401","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"ALD-401 is derived from Autologous Bone Marrow of the Stroke Subject","interventionNames":["Biological: ALD-401"]},{"label":"Sham Comparitor","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sham Bone Marrow harvest and sham dosing procedure.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Sham Procedure"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"ALD-401","description":"3 mL ALDHbr cells isolated from autologous bone marrow given as a one-time infusion via intracarotid infusion.","armGroupLabels":["ALD-401"],"otherNames":["ALDHbr cells","ALDH Bright cells"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Sham Procedure","description":"Sham bone marrow harvest and sham product infusion procedures.","armGroupLabels":["Sham Comparitor"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Safety of Delivery of ALD-401","description":"The safety of the delivery of ALD-401 will be assessed by the following:\n\n* Frequency and proportion of severe adverse events,\n* Physical and clinical laboratory testing,\n* Radiological worsening as detected by MRI (evidence of hemorrhage) with and without clinical symptoms,\n* MRI evidence of new heterotopias, tumors, or vascular malformations over 12 months\n* Increase of NIHSS by ≥ 4 pts within 24 h of injection,\n* Re-hospitalization,\n* Survival.","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Efficacy of recovery of Mental and Physical Function","description":"Determine the efficacy of ALD-401 for recovery of mental and physical function three months after treatment as assessed by the:\n\n* Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)\n* NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS)\n* Barthel Index (BI)\n* European Quality of Life (EQ-5D)","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
