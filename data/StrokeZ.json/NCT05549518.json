Stroke is one of the most common cardiovascular events in the world. In addition to complications such as spasticity, loss of strength, balance problems, speech and swallowing problems, pulmonary complications are also common in stroke. When the literature is examined, there are a limited number of studies evaluating respiratory functions and functional capacity as a result of core stabilization exercises applied to stroke patients. There is no study in the literature examining the results of core stabilization exercises on respiratory functions, functional capacity, trunk control, and balance in stroke patients. The aim of this study; to investigate the effects of core stabilization training applied in addition to traditional physical therapy on respiratory functions, functional capacity, trunk control, and balance in stroke individuals after cerebrovascular accidents.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is a disease that requires rehabilitation practices beyond traditional medical treatments as an approach to managing diseases and complications over time. Physiotherapy and rehabilitation approaches include techniques such as joint range of motion exercises, muscle strengthening, stretching, balance-coordination exercises, neurophysiological approaches (PNF-Bobath), electrical stimulation, orthotic approaches, and breathing exercises. In stroke, especially the lower and upper extremities are emphasized, but trunk dysfunctions are also common. In stroke individuals, weakened trunk muscles cause postural instability, resulting in trunk control disorder, balance problems, and a decrease in physical activity. Decreased trunk control is also associated with decreased pulmonary function and functional capacity. Core Stabilization Exercises (CSE) have recently become a popular form of therapeutic exercise and also play a key role in functional outcomes in stroke individuals. Gradually progressing from easy to difficult, CSE is seen as a critical component of restoring appropriate kinetic function. It is also an exercise approach that aims to prevent compensatory movements, contribute to the motor relearning of inhibited muscles, and strengthen the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles, which are a component of core stability. The aim of this study; to investigate the effects of core stabilization training applied in addition to traditional physical therapy on respiratory functions, functional capacity, trunk control, and balance in stroke individuals after cerebrovascular accidents."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","core stabilization","respiratory parameters","balance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Interventional (Clinical Trial)","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Core stabilization + Traditional Physical Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In addition to the traditional physical therapy training, core stabilization exercises will be applied in this group.","interventionNames":["Other: Core stabilization + Traditional Physical Therapy"]},{"label":"Traditional Physical Therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will continue the traditional physical therapy program.","interventionNames":["Other: Traditional Physical Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Core stabilization + Traditional Physical Therapy","description":"In addition to the traditional physical therapy training, core stabilization exercises will be applied 3 days a week for 6 weeks, and 20 minutes in each session under the supervision of a physiotherapist.
