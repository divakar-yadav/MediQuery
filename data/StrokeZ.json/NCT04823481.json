In those patients, intravenous thrombolysis (IT) is indicated for 4.5 hours after symptoms onset. Due to a lack of data, mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is not considered as a gold standard to treat IS alone or in addition with IT. Therefore, observational studies are needed to understand the clinical evolution of patients with IS treated with IT and/or MT. The ACAPULCO retrospective observational study aims to highlight potential benefits of MT in those patients to improve their management and to propose targeted therapies in the future."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Thrombi"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinico-radiological evolution of IS patients with isolated occlusion of the anterior or posterior cerebral artery.","description":"Good Neurological Condition Good neurological outcome (GNO) at 3 months will defined using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).
