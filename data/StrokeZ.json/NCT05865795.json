Correlation of brain perfusion and size of stroke in relation to systemic hemodynamic targets will be assessed on serial scans.","detailedDescription":"To explore the correlation of brain parenchyma lesions changes and cerebral perfusion parameters as measured by cranial ultrasound transcranial Doppler to patient's blood pressure in a continuous fashion and correlate these to clinical and radiological features of cerebral perfusion. This study will lead to answering clinical management questions like is accurate diagnosis of hemorrhagic stroke possible that could be applied to the field evaluation of stroke patients, optimum blood pressure targets for different subsets of population studied ( multifocal disease, collateralized circulation etc), course of fluctuations in cerebral blood flow in response to systemic blood pressure changes or presence of persistent embolic signals in patients with presumed cardio-embolic strokes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke","Hemorrhagic Stroke"],"keywords":["hypertension","hypotension","stroke therapy","cerebral perfusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Collection of Images","description":"The study will measure and record B mode images, any lesions seen and their size recorded and continuous Transcranial doppler (TCD) velocities acquired via Doppler.
