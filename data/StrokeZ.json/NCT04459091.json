The circulating levels of albumin have proven to be predictors of functional recovery in ischemic stroke and cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nIn the present survey it is hypothesized that it is possible to significantly improve the values of hypoalbuminemia by supplementation with essential amino acids and that, in the second place, any increase in albumin may result in a strengthening of functional recovery in patients with a stroke.","detailedDescription":"In addition to its physiological functions, serum albumin plays a role of neuroprotection in cerebrovascular stroke. The circulating levels of albumin may be reduced in patients with stroke due to the presence of a systemic inflammatory state and to the inadequacy of protein-energy intake. In the patients admitted to the Montescano Neuromotor Rehabilitation Division, the prevalence of hypoalbuminemia is high at the time of admission and remains high, even if decreased, at discharge. The circulating levels of albumin have proven to be predictors of functional recovery in ischemic stroke and cerebral hemorrhage. In the present survey it is hypothesized that it is possible to significantly improve the values of hypoalbuminemia by supplementation with essential amino acids and that, in the second place, any increase in albumin may result in a strengthening of functional recovery in patients with a stroke.\n\nSeveral factors induce the use of free essential amino acids: they are the most efficient inducers of protein synthesis and albumin is a protein; free essential amino acids and not those contained in proteins allow a more reliable use of the isoleucine and tryptophan, true nutrients limiting the hepatic synthesis of albumin; the free essential amino acids have a faster and complete intestinal absorption of the essential amino acids derived from protein digestion."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["Serum Albumin","Essential Amino Acid","Functional Recovery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":125,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Amino essential acids","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"oral supplementation with a mixture of amino essential acids 8 gr die in two administrations for six weeks","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Amino Essential Acid"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"placebo consisting in isocaloric product containing maltodextrins in two administrations for six weeks","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"Amino Essential Acid","description":"8 gr die in two administration","armGroupLabels":["Amino essential acids"]},{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"placebo","description":"8 gr die in two administration","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Serum Albumin Levels","description":"Number of patients who at discharge show levels of albuminemia\\> 0.35 gr / dl (normal level)","timeFrame":"eight weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Independence Measure","description":"The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is an 18-item measurement tool that explores an individual's physical, psychological and social function.
