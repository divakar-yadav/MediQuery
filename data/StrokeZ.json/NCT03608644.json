In Egypt, the total lifetime prevalence of ischemic stroke was 7.2/1,000 in the population aged 20 years and more . Although the intravenous thrombolysis is a treatment option within â‰¤ 4.5 hours after stroke onset, the mechanical thrombectomy can be performed within a more extended time window. A positive results of 5 recent randomized clinical trials are driven mainly from patients treated by mechanical thrombectomy within 6 hours from onset and they demonstrated a clear benefit for mechanical thrombectomy in combination with intravenous thrombolysis. More recent two randomized clinical trials DAWN and DEFUSE 3 demonstrated an overall benefit in functional outcome at 90 days in patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy within 6 to 24 hours or 6 to 16 hours form onset respectively with special criteria. A major issue remains as to identifying patients which likely to benefit from mechanical thrombectomy to improve selection and subsequently clinical prognosis .\n\nThese factors include:-\n\n1. Time of presentation.\n2. Age.\n3. Clinical presentation.\n4. Risk factors include Hyperglycemia, peripheral vessel disease, atrial fibrillation, coronary heart disease, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and history of pervious stroke,\n5. Socioeconomic status.\n6. Collateral and stroke core. In this study the investigators will evaluate prognostic factors influencing angiographic and clinical outcomes at discharge and at three months after mechanical thrombectomy of acute ischemic stroke within 24 hours."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy after acute ischemic stroke within three months","description":"Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) for measuring the degree of disability","timeFrame":"3 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
