These patients are usually not fully awake and need help with their breathing and with preventing them from choking on their secretions. This is done with a breathing tube inserted through the mouth into the lungs and connected to a breathing machine. As patients recover, It is often unclear when the best time is to remove the breathing tube. Doctors might decide to remove it relatively early, or they may wait until the patient is more fully awake, or they may perform a tracheostomy (neck surgery to insert a new tube directly into the windpipe (trachea), replacing the temporary breathing tube). Each of these approaches has risks and benefits. This trial in brain-injured patients will test which of the following will lead to better patient outcomes: (1) an airway management pathway consisting of daily assessments and removal of the breathing tube as soon as patients can breathe on their own and appear able to protect their airway; versus (2) the usual treatment patients would have received if they were not enrolled in this trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Brain Injury"],"keywords":["Subarachnoid Hemorrhage","Diffuse Axonal Injury","Ischemic Stroke","Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Brain Tumor","Global Cerebral Anoxia/Cardiac Arrest","Meningitis/Encephalitis","Cerebral Abscess","Epidural Hematoma","Subdural Hematoma","Seizure"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":332,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Airway Management Pathway","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"An airway management pathway consisting of daily assessments and removal of the breathing tube as soon as patients can breathe on their own and appear able to protect their airway","interventionNames":["Procedure: Airway Management Pathway"]},{"label":"Usual Care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The usual clinical practice is often to keep the patient on artificial respiration for longer in the hope that the patient will wake up before removing the tube, or performing a tracheostomy if the patient doesn't wake up","interventionNames":["Procedure: Usual Care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Airway Management Pathway","description":"Patients in this group will receive several components that comprise airway management pathway: (1) daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs); (2) prompt extubation following successful extubation readiness criteria; (3) high-flow nasal oxygen for at least 24 hours following extubation.","armGroupLabels":["Airway Management Pathway"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Usual Care","description":"Patients in this group will be treated according to usual care, which may include extubation or tracheostomy timed according to treating physicians' discretion.","armGroupLabels":["Usual Care"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Total Duration of Mechanical Ventilation","description":"Total duration of mechanical ventilation (to 60 days) accounting for the competing risk of death","timeFrame":"Up to 60 Days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mortality at ICU discharge and Hospital Discharge","description":"Mortality at ICU Discharge, Hospital Discharge, 3 months, and 6 months","timeFrame":"ICU Discharge, Hospital Discharge, 3 months, and 6 months"},{"measure":"Ventilator-Free Days at Day 60","description":"Days alive and not receiving mechanical ventilation","timeFrame":"Up to 60 days"},{"measure":"ICU Free Days At Day 60","description":"ICU free days (days alive and not spent in an ICU)","timeFrame":"Up to 60 Days"},{"measure":"Airway or Tracheostomy complications","description":"Presence versus absence of airway complication","timeFrame":"Up to 30 days"},{"measure":"Nutrition Intake","description":"Time to normal oral nutrition intake","timeFrame":"Up to 6 Months"},{"measure":"Antibiotics Days","description":"Injection or infusion of antibiotics given intravenously","timeFrame":"Up to 30 Days"},{"measure":"Tracheostomy Rates","description":"Presence versus absence of tracheostomy insertion","timeFrame":"Up to 6 Months"},{"measure":"ICU Readmission Rates","description":"ICU readmission rates to hospital discharge","timeFrame":"Hospital discharge, up to 90 days"},{"measure":"Discharge Destination","description":"Discharge destination for the patient post hospitalization","timeFrame":"Hospital discharge, up to 90 days"},{"measure":"Extended Glasgow Outcome Score","description":"Minimum score 1 (worst) to maximum score 8 (best) at 3 months and 6 months","timeFrame":"3 months and 6 months"},{"measure":"EuroQol-5D","description":"Minimum score 1 (worst) to maximum score 100 (best) at 3 months and 6 months","timeFrame":"3 months and 6 months"},{"measure":"Delirium Free Days","description":"Days alive and free of delirium while in ICU up to day 30","timeFrame":"Up to 30 Days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
