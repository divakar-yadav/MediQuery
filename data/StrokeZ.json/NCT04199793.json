The HeartWare® Ventricular Assist System (HVAD®, HeartWare Inc., Framingham, MA, USA) includes a novel speed modulation feature called Lavare™ cycle. The Lavare™ Cycle is aimed to promote washing of left ventricle to decrease blood stasis and subsequent risk of thrombus formation, ingestion and/or expulsion. No prior study has prospectively evaluated the impact of Lavare™ cycle on patient outcomes in a randomized fashion. We intend to assess effects of Lavare™ Cycle among patients receiving HVAD LVAD in this randomized controlled pilot project.","detailedDescription":"Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients remain at risk for pump thrombus and thromboembolic events through multiple mechanisms. The HeartWare® Ventricular Assist System (HVAD®, HeartWare Inc., Framingham, MA, USA) includes a novel speed modulation feature called Lavare™ cycle. It consists of 3 phases: phase 1 - a 200 rpm decrease from baseline speed for 2 seconds, phase 2 - a 100 rpm increase from baseline for 1 second and phase 3 - return of speed to baseline; this cycle repeats itself once every minute.\n\nThe LavareTM Cycle is aimed to promote washing of left ventricle to decrease blood stasis and subsequent risk of thrombus formation, ingestion and/or expulsion. In a post-hoc analysis of ReVOLVE registry, which includes 248 patients implanted with the HVAD following Conformité Européenne Mark in nine centers in Europe and Australia, no adverse impact on survival was observed with Lavare™ cycle. Additionally, lower risk of stroke, sepsis and right heart failure was observed among those with Lavare™ cycle in the above-mentioned study. However, no prior study has prospectively evaluated the impact of Lavare™ cycle on patient outcomes in a randomized fashion. In this prospective randomized controlled trial, we intend to assess the role of Lavare™ cycle in pump related complications."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Thromboembolism","Hemolysis","Stroke"],"keywords":["Lavare Cycle","HeartWare LVAD","Thromboembolic events"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":9,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Lavare Cycle On","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"For the patients randomized to \"Lavare On\" group, the Lavare™ cycle will be turned on upon device interrogation after patients return to intensive care unit from the operating room.","interventionNames":["Device: Lavare On"]},{"label":"Lavare Cycle Off","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"For the patients randomized to \"Lavare Off\" group, the Lavare™ cycle will be turned off upon device interrogation after patients return to intensive care unit from the operating room.","interventionNames":["Device: Lavare Off"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Lavare On","description":"For the patients randomized to \"Lavare On\" group, the Lavare™ cycle will be turned on upon device interrogation after patients return to intensive care unit from the operating room.","armGroupLabels":["Lavare Cycle On"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Lavare Off","description":"For the patients randomized to \"Lavare Off\" group, the Lavare™ cycle will be turned off upon device interrogation after patients return to intensive care unit from the operating room.","armGroupLabels":["Lavare Cycle Off"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Composite Endpoint of Total Ischemic Events, Thromboembolic Events, Pump Hemolysis or Thrombosis, Pump Exchange","description":"INTERMACS definitions of cerebrovascular events, pump hemolysis/ thrombosis will be used.
