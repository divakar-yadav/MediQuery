Before and after those two months, a 3 days recording will be made using an ambulatory system called TRIDENT.","detailedDescription":"The aim of this multi-center, randomized controlled study is to acquire and compare information on gait performance in patients with chronic hemiplegia (six months to two years post-stroke) who either continue to attend two physical therapy sessions per week for two months or who stop physical therapy sessions for two months. This will permit us 1) to assess the efficacy of continuing physical therapy sessions during the chronic phase of post-stroke hemiplegia, 2) to investigate whether the effects of physical therapy in these patients gradually decreases during the period of six months to two years post-stroke, and 3) to model the relationship between standard measures of gait performance (speed, endurance, balance, use of technical aids...) with other multidimensional covariates: social and environmental factors (type of housing, presence of a third person,...), cognitive factors (cognitive disorders associated) and thymic factors (anxiety, depression) and 4) to assess the costs associated with the physical therapy care of chronic-phase stroke patients ."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegia"],"keywords":["hemiplegia","stroke","TRIDENT"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"patients who continue physical therapy sessions during two months.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: physical therapy sessions"]},{"label":"2","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"patients who stop physical therapy sessions during two months"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"physical therapy sessions","description":"two physical therapy sessions per week for two months","armGroupLabels":["1"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"the average number of steps per day recorded over 3 days in an outpatient setting","timeFrame":"day 3 and then 6 months later"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"the scores to the scales (the 6 minutes walking test, the Wade's test, the Rivermead Mobility Index Score, the Barthel Index Score)","timeFrame":"day 0 and then day 55"},{"measure":"for the medico-economic study, the direct medical and non-medical costs associated with physical therapy of chronic stroke patients","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must be aged 18 to 75 years, with a first ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke at least six months ago and no longer than two years ago, without subsequent stroke.
