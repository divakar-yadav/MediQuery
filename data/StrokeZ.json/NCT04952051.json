Homocysteine (Hcy) is a substance in the body that is harmful to blood vessels. Hyperhomocysteinemia (plasma Hcyâ‰¥10 mol/L), which is associated with hypertension, significantly increases the risk of stroke. This type of high blood pressure is called type \"H\" hypertension. Enalapril folic acid tablet is an innovative drug developed independently in China and is the first choice for the treatment of H type hypertension. Patients with type H hypertension should be treated with enalapril folic acid tablets to reduce stroke.\n\nHowever, some patients had poor blood pressure control after monotherapy. At this time, other antihypertensive drugs should be used in combination. Amlodipine and Hydrochlorothiazide are the most commonly used and the best combination.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to observe the difference in the efficacy of enalapril folic acid tablets in patients with uncontrolled blood pressure who were well tolerated and randomized to aminoclodipine or hydrochlorothiazide in reducing stroke and other cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, and to explore the relationship between various alternative measures and efficacy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hypertension"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Enalapril Folic Acid Tablets Combined With amlodipine","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Enalapril Folic Acid Tablets 10.8mg Combined With amlodipine 5 or 10mg","interventionNames":["Drug: Enalapril Folic Acid Tablets Combined With amlodipine"]},{"label":"Enalapril Folic Acid Tablets Combined With hydrochlorothiazide","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Enalapril Folic Acid Tablets 10.8mg Combined With hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 or 25mg","interventionNames":["Drug: Enalapril Folic Acid Tablets Combined With hydrochlorothiazide"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Enalapril Folic Acid Tablets Combined With amlodipine","description":"Enalapril Folic Acid Tablets 10.8mg Combined With amlodipine 5 or 10mg","armGroupLabels":["Enalapril Folic Acid Tablets Combined With amlodipine"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Enalapril Folic Acid Tablets Combined With hydrochlorothiazide","description":"Enalapril Folic Acid Tablets 10.8mg Combined With hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 or 25mg","armGroupLabels":["Enalapril Folic Acid Tablets Combined With hydrochlorothiazide"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke rate","timeFrame":"Until 5 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of combined end points of cardiovascular events","description":"Including cardiogenic death, cerebrovascular death, non-fatal stroke, and myocardial infarction","timeFrame":"Until 5 years"},{"measure":"Rate of all causes of death","description":"Including all causes and unexplained deaths","timeFrame":"Until 5 years"},{"measure":"Rate of first or recurrent ischemic stroke","timeFrame":"Until 5 years"},{"measure":"Rate of first or recurrent hemorrhagic stroke","timeFrame":"Until 5 years"},{"measure":"Rate of myocardial infarction","timeFrame":"Until 5 years"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of heart failure (hospitalization)","timeFrame":"Until 5 years"},{"measure":"Rate of coronary revascularization","timeFrame":"Until 5 years"},{"measure":"Rate of peripheral arterial revascularization","timeFrame":"Until 5 years"},{"measure":"Rate of malignant tumor","timeFrame":"Until 5 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 1.40-75 years old (inclusive);\n* 2.
