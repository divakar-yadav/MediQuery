Loss of arm function occurs in up to 85% of stroke survivors. The impact of arm-related limitations on activities of daily living, leisure activities or work is significant as the arm plays a central role in a person's life from the ability to perform basic activities of daily life to carrying out family and social roles. Guidelines indicate that rehabilitation can improve upper extremity (UE) motor control and functional status post stroke. Virtual reality (VR) and computer games are recent technologies that, as they become more accessible and affordable,are increasingly being used in rehabilitation to allow patients to engage in repetitive practice of specific tasks. A number of published reviews and meta-analyses have examined the use of VR and video games for post-stroke rehabilitation, focusing on or including UE rehabilitation. The authors agree that there is limited but promising findings that VR and video-games, when combined with traditional rehabilitation, have a positive impact on recovery post-stroke.","detailedDescription":"The goal of the study is to assess the feasibility, safety, and acceptability of the Jintronix system, as well as provide preliminary evidence regarding the clinical efficacy for post-stroke rehabilitation.This is a pilot parallel randomised single-blinded controlled trial, with patients who have had a stroke randomly allocated to one of two groups: (1) usual rehabilitation services and additional training with Jintronix system (treatment group) or (2) usual rehabilitation services only (control group)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["virtual reality","exergame","stroke rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention arm, usual rehabilitation + Jintronix exergame","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"On top of the usual out-patient rehabilitation sessions planned for the participant, participants attend sessions to use the Jintronix system for up 30 minutes up to 3 times per week","interventionNames":["Other: Exergame"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"OTHER","description":"Participants continue their prescribed rehabilitation sessions","interventionNames":["Other: usual care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Exergame","description":"Participants use exergame with the therapist in the rehabilitation center.
