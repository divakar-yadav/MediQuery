However, few studies mentioned the benefit and safety of the emergent stenting in the successful recanalization at these complex occlusions. The investigators investigated whether the improvement of clinical outcome was achieved in postprocedural 3-month.","detailedDescription":"Acute ischemic stroke in posterior circulation account for nearly 20 - 25%, in which large vessel occlusions (LVOs) occur 0.8% - 5.7% of two circulation strokes. Although mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has recently been the gold standard in LVOs treatment, the futile recanalization (defined as unfavorable outcome despite early successful recanalization of target artery) rate was showed in posterior circulation higher than in anterior one. Multiple randomized controlled trials (BEST, BASICS, BAOCHE, ATTENTION) have recently reported the benefit of emergent stenting for acute vertebrobasilar occlusions stroke in order to support the successful recanalization in the setting of failure of mechanical thrombectomy. Moreover, the successful recanalization is one of the independent predictors of favorable outcomes. However, the use of the loading dose dual antiplatelet therapy and peri-procedural complications made the safety of emergent stenting remain uncertain. Therefore, the investigators aimed to investigate the impact of emergent stenting on the improved recanalization and clinical outcome in vertebrobasilar occlusions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke","Ischemic Stroke, Acute","Vertebro Basilar Ischemia"],"keywords":["vertebrobasilar occlusions","acute ischemic stroke","emerging stenting"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Emergent Stenting","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Emergent Stenting In Acute Vertebrobasilar Occlusions","interventionNames":["Procedure: Emergent Stenting"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Emergent Stenting","description":"Emergent Stenting In Acute Vertebrobasilar Occlusions","armGroupLabels":["Emergent Stenting"],"otherNames":["ES"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The favorable 3-month outcome rate","description":"The favorable 3-month outcome rate was accessed by modified Rankin Score (mRS), which comprised of included good (mRS 0 - ≤ 2) and fair (mRS 3).","timeFrame":"3 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage rate","description":"The symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was defined as patient's intracerebral hemorrhage with postprocedural mRS ≥ 5 and there were no other evident causes for the increased mRS","timeFrame":"24 hours after emergent stenting"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age \\> 18 years old\n* Onset to treatment time \\< 24 hours\n* NIHSS ≥ 10\n* pc-ASPECTS ≥ 5 on MRI\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Premorbid mRS \\> 2\n* Unavailable stents\n* Extensive, bilateral brain-stem infarction on neuroimaging\n* Cerebellar mass effect on neuroimaging","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"19 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Cuong Tran Chi, Doctor","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+84886559911","email":"drcuongtran@dotquy.vn"},{"name":"Can Tho Stroke International Services Hospital","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+84886559911","email":"cskh@dotquy.vn"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Cuong Tran Chi, Doctor","affiliation":"Can Tho Stroke International Services General Hospital","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Can Tho Stroke International Services Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Can Tho","zip":"900000","country":"Vietnam","contacts":[{"name":"Cuong Tran Chi, Doctor","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+84886559911","email":"drcuongtran@dotquy.vn"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":10.03711,"lon":105.78825}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"36263574","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Tran CC, Le MT, Baxter BW, Nguyen-Luu G, Ngo MT, Nguyen-Dao NH, Duong-Hoang L, Mai-Van M, Nguyen MD.
