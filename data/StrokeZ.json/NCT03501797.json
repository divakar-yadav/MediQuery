Using a cross-over RCT design, half of the participants receive a 4-month singing intervention during the first half of the study and half of the participants during the second half of the study.","detailedDescription":"BACKGROUND: Singing is a highly stimulating and versatile activity for the brain, combining vocal-motor, auditory, linguistic, cognitive, emotional, and social brain processes, both in the left and right hemisphere. The capacity to sing is often preserved in aphasia after stroke, and singing-based methods, such as Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT), can be effective in rehabilitating speech production in aphasics. Also emotionally and socially, singing could provide a powerful alternative channel for aphasic patients to express their emotions and interact with others, but the communal or group-level use of singing in aphasia rehabilitation has not been systematically studied.\n\nAIMS: The purpose of the study is to determine the clinical and neural efficacy of a novel choir singing intervention in subacute/chronic aphasia. Specifically, the targeted outcomes are (i) verbal and vocal-motor skills, (ii) cognitive skills, (iii) emotional functioning and quality of life, (iv) caregiver psychological well-being, and (v) structural and functional neuroplasticity. In addition, the capacity of singing and music learning in aphasia is explored.\n\nMETHODS: Subjects are 60 stroke patients with at least minor aphasia (≥ 6 months post-stroke) and their family members (FMs, N = 60) from Helsinki area recruited to a cross-over RCT study. Participants are randomized to two groups \\[N = 60 in both (30 patients, 30 FMs)\\], which receive a 16-week choir intervention either during the first (AB group) or second (BA group) half of the follow-up. The intervention is a combination of group training, which utilizes a novel combination of traditional senior choir singing and MIT-like speech training protocols, and home training in which the choir material is trained with a tablet computer. All patients are evaluated at baseline, 5-month, and 9-month stages with language, cognitive, and auditory-music tests and questionnaires. Half of the patients (N = 30) also undergo electroencephalography (EEG) and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (s/fMRI). FMs are evaluated with questionnaires."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Aphasia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Early
