The appearance of nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes the development of neuroprotective therapy, but it has little effect on stroke because of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Electroacupuncture (EA) has been used for stroke, while there is no significant clinical effect for recovery phrase. Consequently, we will conduct a multicentre, randomised, controlled, assessor-blinded clinical trial to assess the effectiveness and safety of EA combined with NGF treatment on ischemic stroke recovery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Convalescence","Electroacupuncture","nerve growth factor"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"people who are14 days to 6 months after stroke onset","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","maskingDescription":"In this trail, it's difficult to blind researchers, because they perform sham EA or EA, and inject NGF or placebo on patients.
