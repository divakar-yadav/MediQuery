Evidence of intracranial haemorrhage or significant non-stroke intracranial pathology likely to account for clinical presentation or represent a risk of intracerebral haemorrhage (eg Central Nervous System neoplasm) on pre-treatment computerised tomography (CT) scan; Stroke within the previous 14 days, thrombolytic therapy within the past 14 days, or hypodensity on pre-treatment computerised tomography (CT) scan consistent with recent cerebral ischaemia other than the presenting event; Systolic blood pressure more than 185 or diastolic blood pressure more than 110 mmHg, or aggressive management (intravenous pharmacotherapy) necessary to reduce blood pressure to these limits; Clinical history suggestive of subarachnoid haemorrhage even if no blood is evident on computerised tomography (CT) scan; High risk of haemorrhage, including major surgery, trauma or gastrointestinal or urinary tract haemorrhage within the previous 21 days; Arterial puncture at a non-compressible site within the previous 7 days; Prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (\\> 2 minutes) within the previous 14 days; Acute pericarditis and/or subacute bacterial endocarditis; acute pancreatitis;

defect of clotting or platelet function (other than antiplatelet therapy); Hypo- or hyperglycaemia (blood glucose \\<2 mmol/l or \\>18 mmol/l) sufficient to account for neurological symptoms; Seizure
