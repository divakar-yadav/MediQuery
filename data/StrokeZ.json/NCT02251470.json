Pilot studies with stroke patients indicate that the application of Nintendo Wii® (WII) is practicable and can improve balance under clinical conditions. However, larger trials are necessary to verify these positive effects after discharge from the hospital.\n\nAIM: This study aims to prepare and optimize a phase III trial which compares the effects of two HBE programs for stroke patients.\n\nMETHODS: A pilot study with randomized control design and repeated measures over three-months will be conducted. Twenty elderly stroke patients will be randomly allocated to an experimental group (EG) and a control group (CG). All participants will receive an introduction to a HBE program by an individual mentoring over 6 weeks. During the following 6 weeks the participants perform the HBE on their own. The EG will perform a balance exercise program using the WII, the CG will perform a balance exercise program without technical support.\n\nRecruiting potential, the participants' acceptance of the intervention and economic aspects will be examined. Additionally, basic information about sensitivity of change and potential effect sizes regarding the proposed instruments to measure mobility are expected."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","balance","exer-gaming","home-based exercises","Wii","postural balance","Nintendo","balance board","Wii-Fit","home","feasibility"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":14,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"HBE Wii (EG)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants receive an introduction of using the Nintendo Wii by an individual mentoring for over 6 weeks (a total of 6 sessions á 60 minutes).
