During acute phase, a stroke patient would admit to internal medicine or surgical ward and transferred to rehabilitative ward for more intensive therapeutic programs, restoring muscle power and promoting activity of daily life(ADL) ability. Under relative stable condition, the patient would transfer to PAC institution or hospitals afterwards for continuing rehabilitative program if the patient is acknowledged to have rehabilitative potentials. However, there's still lacking of investigation upon whether the length of stay in PAC correlates to general improvements. Thus, stroke patients' functional ability, such as activities of daily living (ADL) function, swallowing ability and so on, as well as their corresponding scales were assessed on the first and last day during PAC hospitalization. Statistical analysis was conducted via SPSS ver21.0 to compare the relationship of improvements in functional ability and the length of stay in PAC. We're looking forward to the final results!","detailedDescription":"Functional ability in stroke patients are evaluated by following measurements. Activity of daily life (ADL) function was estimated through modified Rankin scale(MRS) and Barthel index(BI), swallowing ability by functional oral intake scale, nutritional status via mini nutritional assessment, life quality through EuroQoL-5D, instrumental ADL function by Lawton-Brody IADL Scale(IADL), balance/coordination via Berg Balance Test, walking speed through Usual Gait Speed, cardiopulmonary capability by Six-Minute Walk Test, occupational mobility (amount use/quality) via Motor Activity Log, language through concise Chinese aphasia test, motor function of upper extremities by Fugl-Meyer Assessment and so on."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":305,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"stroke patient with complete post-acute care hospitalization","description":"This study aims on stroke patients with complete rehabilitative program in post acute care institution and we try to assess their functional improvements after rehabilitative training.","interventionNames":["Other: Rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Rehabilitation","description":"The stroke patients who admitted to post acute care(PAC) institution would undergo regular rehabilitation.","armGroupLabels":["stroke patient with complete post-acute care hospitalization"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Activity of daily life function","description":"Activity of daily life function is evaluated by both Barthel index(Range: 0\\~100 score; higher score indicates better function) and Modified Rankin Scale(Grade 1\\~6; the lower grade indicates better function).
