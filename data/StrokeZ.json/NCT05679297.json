The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be also used to assess the cerebral processing of heat/cold stimuli in patients with thalamic pain compared to thalamic stroke patients without pain, to patients with migraine (other central pain disorder) and to normal controls. In addition the researchers want to assess the somatosensory profile of thalamic pain patients and compare it with thalamic stroke patients without pain, patients with migraine (pain control) and normal controls."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Central Post-stroke Pain"],"keywords":["thalamic pain","thalamic stroke","chronic pain","sensory abnormalities","pain disorder","migraine"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with thalamic CPSP (central post-stroke pain)","description":"Patients with CPSP of thalamic origin due to stroke.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Quantitative sensory testing (QST)","Diagnostic Test: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)","Other: Clinical interview/exam","Other: Follow-up interview"]},{"label":"Patients with thalamic stroke without CPSP","description":"Patients with thalamic stroke at least 2 years ago, but without CPSP or other chronic pain disorders","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Quantitative sensory testing (QST)","Diagnostic Test: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)","Other: Clinical interview/exam","Other: Follow-up interview"]},{"label":"Patients with migraine","description":"Patients with migraine (other central pain disorder)","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Quantitative sensory testing (QST)","Diagnostic Test: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)","Other: Clinical interview/exam"]},{"label":"Healthy controls","description":"Age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Quantitative sensory testing (QST)","Diagnostic Test: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Quantitative sensory testing (QST)","description":"The QST is a standardized, internationally accepted test battery consisting of several well-established, non-invasive tests, measuring parameters, which reflect nearly all aspects of somatosensation.\n\n1.

A summary evaluation is carried out for the affective scale. For this purpose, the total value (0-12) is formed from the individual ratings (each from 0 to 3) of the last four items (affective adjectives: miserable, horrid, horrible, terrible). A total value of 8 (corresponds to a percentage of 75%) can be set as the limit value for an increased affective experience of pain; values above this are to be assessed as conspicuous.","timeFrame":"Two time assessment at baseline and 8-year-follow-up with a duration of max. 60 minutes."},{"measure":"Longitudinal evaluation of clinical development in CPSP","description":"The clinical development of CPSP will be assessed by an 8-year follow-up interview via phone call.
