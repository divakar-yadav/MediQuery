Inflammation, through a key player, the macrophage, is associated with increased metabolic activity of atherosclerotic plaque and its possible rupture. Inflammation within the plate is thus a marker of instability. These data underscore the importance of a prospective evaluation of inflammation with specific imaging with PET tracers inflammation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Positron emission tomography","Carotid plaque","Inflammation","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: 18F-PBR06"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"18F-PBR06","description":"Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET-CT) using 18F-PBR06","armGroupLabels":["Experimental arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Correlation between the value of standardized uptake value (SUV) on PET-CT with 18F-PBR06 and the degree of macrophage infiltration at histological examination","timeFrame":"15 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Levels of leukocyte and T lymphocyte inflammation of the plaque","description":"Evaluate the constitutive parameters of the plaque (surface area, thickness, necrotic core and fibrous cap)","timeFrame":"15 days"},{"measure":"Plaque parameters composite","description":"Evaluate the constitutive parameters of the plaque (surface area, thickness, necrotic core and fibrous cap)","timeFrame":"15 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Man with transient ischemic attack or recent ischemic stroke (\\<15j) in the carotid territory, confirmed by MRI\n* Man with carotid stenosis\\> 50% on the side of stroke\n* Male candidate for carotid endarterectomy\n* Subject affiliated or beneficiary of a social security scheme\n* Informed written consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Women\n* Chronic inflammatory disease in progress (cancer, vasculitis, ...)\n* Patient with infection within 7 days\n* A person placed under judicial protection, guardianship\n* Incapable of giving consent\n* Low affinity binder for TSPO","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"MALE","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Paolo ZANOTTI-FREGONARA","affiliation":"University Hospital, Bordeaux","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Paul Perez","affiliation":"University Hospital, Bordeaux","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"CHU de Bordeaux","city":"Bordeaux","zip":"33074","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":44.84044,"lon":-0.5805}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"33950298","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Schollhammer R, Lepreux S, Barthe N, Vimont D, Rullier A, Sibon I, Berard X, Zhang A, Kimura Y, Fujita M, Innis RB, Zanotti-Fregonara P, Morgat C.
