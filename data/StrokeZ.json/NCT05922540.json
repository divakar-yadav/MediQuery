Various biological samples such as blood, feces, and urine are collected to identify biomarkers associated with ischemic stroke. By integrating demographic information, clinical indicators, imaging parameters, and biomarker parameters, the study aims to develop risk assessment, early warning, and prognosis prediction models. Additionally, the study aims to identify key genes and explore relevant signaling pathways related to ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischaemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"those with favorable prognosis","interventionNames":["Other: Intravenous thrombolysis"]},{"label":"those with unfavorable prognosis","interventionNames":["Other: Intravenous thrombolysis"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Intravenous thrombolysis","description":"Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase within the time window of stroke onset in stroke patients","armGroupLabels":["those with favorable prognosis","those with unfavorable prognosis"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cerebrovascular events","description":"Cerebrovascular events, including ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage","timeFrame":"3 months of onset in patients"},{"measure":"mRS scores","description":"Assessing patients' neurological functional impairment status using the mRS score","timeFrame":"3 months of onset in patients"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
