Although a number of clinical assessments are used to measure neglect, it is unclear whether items from some of the most commonly used assessments are able to effectively and comprehensively measure neglect. This study will determine whether these assessments measure different aspects of neglect and whether items from various neglect assessments can be combined to more effectively measure neglect.","detailedDescription":"Many individuals have difficulty attending to the affected side of their body or to the affected side of space after stroke (unilateral neglect). Although a number of clinical assessments are used to measure this inattention, it is unclear whether items from some of the most commonly used assessments are able to effectively and comprehensively measure inattention. Clinical assessments provide critical information to clinicians and researchers and are used to inform treatment and document patient progress. Therefore, it is important that investigators more closely examine these existing assessments.\n\nIndividuals who demonstrate impaired attention to the affected side after stroke also have greater motor impairment than individuals who do not have impaired attention, but investigators do not know how inattention affects reaching movements using the impaired arm. This study will examine various methods used to assess inattention to the affected side after stroke and also examine how inattention affects reaching movements of the impaired arm."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemispatial Neglect"],"keywords":["Stroke","Neglect","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":55,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke Survivors","description":"Individuals who have experienced a unilateral hemispheric stroke"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Catherine Bergego Scale","timeFrame":"One-time assessment scheduled over 1-2 days"},{"measure":"Behavioral Inattention Test","timeFrame":"One-time assessment scheduled over 1-2 days"},{"measure":"Naturalistic Action Test","timeFrame":"One-time assessment scheduled over 1-2 days"},{"measure":"Virtual Reality Lateralized Attention Test","timeFrame":"One-time assessment scheduled over 1-2 days"},{"measure":"Kinematic Assessment of Arm Movement","timeFrame":"One-time assessment scheduled over 1-2 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Arm Use measured by Accelerometers","description":"Accelerometers will be issued on the first assessment day.
