Perfusion and collateral vessel imaging is a possible approach for doing this. These imaging techniques are able to differentiate ischemic core in parenchymal tissue in the brain versus salvageable penumbra tissue around the core. Also the recanalization status of blood vessels can be evaluated using this technique. This study wishes to investigate if the x-ray C-arm in the treatment room can generate perfusion and collateral images of clinical value during treatment, using a technique known as C-arm computed tomography. If this study shows that to be the case, then it might be feasible in the future to bypass CT or MR perfusion/collateral imaging for some patients when they arrive at the hospital, since all this imaging can be done in the treatment room. In the future, this imaging approach may have the potential to simplify and improve patient workflows and reduce the time between hospital arrival and treatment for these patients and could also potentially compensate for missing imaging information."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ischemic Stroke","description":"Percutaneous neurovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Percutaneous treatment of ischemic stroke"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Percutaneous treatment of ischemic stroke","description":"An additional C-arm CT imaging scan will be done during neurovascular treatment to evaluate perfusion and collateral vessels in ischemic stroke patients.","armGroupLabels":["Ischemic Stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of participants with clinically valuable CACT perfusion images based on a 5-point Likert scale","description":"C-arm computed tomography acquisition perfusion/collateral protocols that provide sufficient image quality to be able to assess ischemic brain perfusion, recanalization and ischemic regions effectively.
