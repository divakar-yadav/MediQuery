MicroNET-covered stent is implanted using direct carotid artery access and temporary flow reversal to combine optimal intraprocedural cerebral protection and optimal plaque exclusion.","detailedDescription":"Prospective, single-center clinical study in consecutive patients undergoing carotid revascularization with MicroNET-covered stent implanted through direct carotid artery access with temporary, intraprocedural flow reversal neuroprotection to provide primary and secondary stroke prevention.\n\nIt is an open-label, non-randomized single-arm study supported by the grant from Jagiellonian University Medical college (K/ZDS/007819).\n\nStroke is a major health problem affecting individual patients and their families and entire societies with death and disability impact (fundamental disability cause in Poland, Europe, and the USA). Atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis plays an important part in a stroke etiology through embolic and/or hemodynamic mechanism).\n\nEndovascular treatment with first-generation carotid stents is inherently related to plaque and thrombus prolapse through stent struts, as confirmed with the intravascular imaging (IVUS and OCT), and monitoring of cerebral embolism by DW-MRI. Plaque prolapse related embolism may occur after neuroprotection device removal. Postprocedural plaque-prolapse related ischemic events are responsible for 40-60% complications up to 30 days, as indicated by 30-day results of large clinical trials (CAPTURE, CREST, or ICSS).\n\nA successful attempt to address this problem has been an introduction and routine use of MicroNET-covered stent. The MicroNET attached to the metallic stent prevents intraluminal plaque prolapse. MRI imaging indicated a significant reduction of intraprocedural embolism and near-elimination of post-procedural brain embolism by CGuard application. Clinical research and meta-analysis of studies confirmed the safety and efficacy of the stent. Consistent results were demonstrated in registries such as PARADIGM.\n\nAnother critical approach in increasing the safety of the endovascular route of carotid revascularization is development and increased clinical uptake of minimally invasive endovascular strategies is the direct common carotid artery access for stenting procedures. This way, one can avoid femoral cannulation and navigation through the aorta and aortic arch branches. Trans-Carotid Arterial Revascularization (TCAR) offers a neuroprotection mechanism by a temporary reversal of the cerebral flow similar to Mo.Ma Ultra or GORE Flow Reversal systems, but without limitations of femoral access and aortic arch cannulation. TCAR system was CE marked in 2014, and more than 20 000 TCAR procedures were performed worldwide. A recent analysis by Yee et al. demonstrated that TCAR carotid stenting procedures are equivalent to surgical endarterectomy regarding safety and efficacy, but with lower invasiveness, avoiding the aortic arch (and its cannulation-related cerebral embolism) and shortened procedure time.\n\nAccording to published studies and our own experience, proximal neuroprotection, and in particular, the one achieved through direct carotid artery access, minimizes cerebral (micro)embolization risk.\n\nOur prospective TOP-GUARD study aims to evaluate early-, mid- and longterm outcome data (up to 5 years) on the results of carotid revascularization combining two systems that are currently considered safest: temporary cerebral flow-reversal during stent introduction via direct carotid artery access and MicroNET-covered stent implantation.\n\nBoth systems are CE-marked (from 2014), have been successfully used in our center, and will follow their on-label indications.\n\nThe TCAR system from SilkRoad Medical (EnRoute) is the preferred method to obtain flow reversal for transcervical CAS in the study. However, due to interruption of the EnRoute system supplies (COVID19, SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic), routinely available sheaths, catheters, and blood filters may be used according to literature to assemble the flow reversal circuit, enabling continuation of the study as per the Ethical Committee updated approval.\n\nConsecutive patients with symptoms or signs of cerebral ischemia (ie. patients with an increased risk of complications when conventional carotid stents and neuroprotection systems are used) will undergo NeuroVascular Team (neurologist, interventionalist, and vascular surgeon) evaluation for their eligibility. They will be treated according to the center standard of care, including necessary peri- and postprocedural medication.\n\nMRI cerebral imaging will be performed at baseline, 24-48 hours post-procedurally and at 90 days in 50% of study participants."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Artery
