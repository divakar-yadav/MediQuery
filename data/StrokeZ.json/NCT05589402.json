In this study, the aim is to determine if temporarily numbing non-paralyzed arm muscles with an over-the-counter numbing cream while exercising paralyzed muscles, can improve the strength, function, and sensation of paralyzed muscles after a spinal cord injury.","detailedDescription":"The functional benefits of temporary deafferentation (numbing)-induced cortical plasticity have been demonstrated in individuals with stroke, nerve damage, and pain syndromes. Of note, documented benefits have included improvements in motor function and touch perception in the weaker muscles. For example, Weiss et al demonstrated that temporary deafferentation to the forearm of the paretic limb in stroke for two hours during movement therapy improved motor performance of the hand by 10 to 48% after a single session. Another study established that bi-weekly sessions of temporary deafferentation for two weeks improved two-point discrimination and touch perception in individuals with ulnar/median nerve damage. More importantly, the authors found that improvements were retained for more than four weeks after the intervention ended. Collectively, this suggests that the release of tonic inhibition on weak muscle pathways, through temporary deafferentation, can lead to functional benefits that are retained long-term.\n\nThe Investigators' pilot findings indicate that temporary deafferentation shows similar benefits in the population of SCI. Specifically, it was observed that a single 30-minute session of temporary deafferentation to the stronger biceps can improve excitability to the weaker triceps and result in gains in hand dexterity and pinch strength in SCI.\n\nThe Investigators now seek to optimize the current study protocol before a large-scale clinical trial is conducted."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spinal Cord Injuries","Spine Disease","Stroke"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Numbing","temporary deafferentation-induced cortical plasticity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Lidocaine Cream 5%","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A topical anesthetic will be used to deliver temporary inactivation of muscle sensation. Specifically, due to its high safety profile, Lidocaine Cream 5% will be used in the current sub-study. Lidocaine cream (5%) is FDA-approved and available over-the-counter. The investigators will apply the lidocaine cream 5% following FDA guidelines and previously published protocol methodology. A test will be utilized to evaluate if the approach provides complete and temporary inactivation of sensation from the biceps. The von Frey filament test will be used with filaments ranging in size (1,65 to 6,65) to be placed on the biceps muscle every 15 minutes after lidocaine application.\n\nBased on published work, and the current investigators' pilot data, it is anticipated that all sensations from the biceps should be blocked approximately 30 to 60 minutes after lidocaine application. Complete temporary inactivation will be defined at the point when all baseline sensation can no longer be achieved.","interventionNames":["Drug: Lidocaine Cream 5%"]},{"label":"Rehabilitation Movement Training","type":"OTHER","description":"During temporary deafferentation, subjects will perform movement training. Similar to other single-session studies, the current investigators chose to pair the paradigm with movement training to bolster the effects of the approach.\n\nA reaching task that is commonly performed in rehabilitation will be used. Task practice will be performed for 1 hour, with breaks given every 10 minutes. Past experiments in the current investigators' lab have adopted a similar protocol for task practice in SCI and found no adverse events. Movement training will also be assisted by the Bionik InMotion Arm/Hand robot, which has been studied in clinical and rehabilitative practices for over 20 years.\n\nMovement training at 1 hour will be ceased due to issues with fatigue, as has been noted in previous SCI clinical studies. In addition, published work suggests that lidocaine has a half-life of one 1 hour. Thus, maximum benefits should be achieved at the 1-hour mark after application.","interventionNames":["Other: Rehabilitation Movement Training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Lidocaine Cream 5%","description":"Ebanel 5% Lidocaine Topical Numbing Cream Maximum Strength 1.35 Oz, Numb520 Pain Relief Cream Anesthetic Cream Infused with Aloe Vera, Vitamin E, Lecithin, Allantoin, Secured with Child Resistant Cap","armGroupLabels":["Lidocaine Cream 5%"],"otherNames":["Ebanel","UBER NUMB"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Rehabilitation Movement Training","description":"reaching tasks, hand exercises (e.g., putty, grip exerciser, resistance bands, etc).","armGroupLabels":["Rehabilitation Movement Training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Electromyography (EMG)","description":"The investigators will use an electrical stimulator to send an electrical signal to a target muscle to initiate contraction, and an Electromyography (EMG) will be used to record the changes in target muscle response from baseline, pre-test, and post-test.\n\nAn electronic nerve stimulator will output a pulse ranging from 0 mV to 2 mV for an appropriate maximum muscle contraction to occur, and an Electromyography (EMG in root mean square) will capture the muscle's contraction via surface electrodes.
