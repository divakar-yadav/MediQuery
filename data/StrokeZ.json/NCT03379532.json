Hence, to improve recovery of upper limb movements it will be crucial to re-establish and strengthen CST projections.\n\nRecent studies provided evidence that closed-loop brain computer interface-driven electrical stimulation of the paretic muscles can induce clinically important and lasting recovery of upper limb function, even in patients with chronic, severe motor affection. In this treatment approach, movement intentions of the patients are detected with electroencephalography and real-time analyses. This triggers an electrical stimulation of affected upper limb muscles.\n\nIn this study, the investigators hypothesize that neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) applied contingent to voluntary activation of primary motor cortex, as detected by a brain-computer interface (BCI), can help restore CST projections. This might improve recovery of patients with severe upper limb movement deficits. Treatment will be started within the first 8 weeks after stroke onset."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":31,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"BCI-NMES","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Electrical stimulation of paretic upper limb is triggered contigent to voluntary motor cortex activation of the patient, as detected by the brain-computer interface.","interventionNames":["Device: BCI-NMES"]},{"label":"Sham-NMES","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Electrical stimulation of paretic upper limb is applied independently of motor cortex activation of the patient by using a prerecorded session of another patient.","interventionNames":["Device: Sham-NMES"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"BCI-NMES","description":"From the recorded brain activity (EEG) subject specific patterns will be extracted with machine learning techniques from recordings where the subject executes movements tasks.
