This study investigates whether the application of botulinum toxin to a set of synergistically-acting hand muscles, in conjunction with task-specific therapy, will lead to reorganization and improved motor function in the stroke-involved hand. The investigators will use objective psychophysical measures of hand function and hand function rating scales to investigate if Botox in conjunction with task-specific therapy will lead to:\n\n* improved motor execution,\n* improved motor planning during a psychophysical two-finger grasping and lifting task with varying object weight, and\n* increased hand function as assessed by the time taken to complete fine motor tasks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke With Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Fingers","Grasp","Hand","Strength","Brain Infraction","Pathology","Physiopathology","Functional Laterality","Neuronal Plasticity","Psychomotor Performance","Biomechanics","Touch","Weight-Bearing"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Botulinum Toxin commonly known as BOTOX®","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Some subjects will receive BOTOX® injections.
