The application that uses an Internet of Things (IoT) platform to enable remote monitoring of rehabilitation progress by clinical practitioners. Simultaneously, it seeks to assist the execution of patient movements through devices.\n\nIn patients with stroke, half of the participants will be assigned to experimental group, receiving a smart upper limb motor rehabilitation system for home program. The other half will be assigned to control group, receiving a traditional home program. In patients with spinal cord injuries. Participants will follow the same allocation method for home-based intervention.\n\nResearchers will conduct an analysis before and after intervention, examining progress in motor function, activities of daily living, and quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Spinal Cord Injuries"],"keywords":["stroke","spinal cord injury","robot-assisted therapy","tele-rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke: TIGER group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the TIGER (tenodesis-induced-grip exoskeleton robot) group will operate the TIGER system.
