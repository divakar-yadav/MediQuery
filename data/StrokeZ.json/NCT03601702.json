The Screening Log will collect all the stroke cases treated from each centre during the enrollment period to show the rate of EmboTrap®II Clot Retriever (Neuravi) use over the total cases treated and the reasons for choosing other devices. The registry will enroll at least 100 consecutive patients presenting within 12 hours from symptom onset with a Large Vessel Occlusion (LVO) on CTA or MRA in the Anterior or Posterior Proximal Cerebral Vasculature up to A1, M1, Dominant M2, P1 who will be treated using the EmboTrap®II Clot Retriever (Neuravi) as first intention and used according to the Instructions For Use. The registry objectives are to evaluate the efficacy/safety of the device Embotrap II Clot Retriever(Neuravi), as first line treatment in the restoration of cerebral blood flow in cases of acute ischemic stroke from Large Vessel Occlusion. Efficacy is considered when a \"modified Treatment in Cerebral Infarction\" (mTICI) score of 2b or greater is achieved in the vessel treated with the (Neuravi). Safety refers to the rate of procedure-related and device-related hemorrhages. Number and severity of hemorrhages will be evaluated considering site and size. The first follow-up control will occur at 1 to 10 days post-procedure, the second at 90 days+/-14 days. In addition to the sample, the patients meeting the inclusion criteria and treated using the EmboTrap®II Clot Retriever (Neuravi) as second intention, will also be included in the study and considered only for a specific secondary endpoint."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["acute ischemic stroke","endovascular treatment","stent retriever device","mechanical
