On the basis of previous studies, standardized randomized controlled clinical trials were conducted to observe the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of mild cognitive impairment after stroke using the international rating scale, and the clinical experience was transformed into evidence.\n2. According to the clinical outcomes reported by patients, the differences between Chinese and western scales in evaluating mild cognitive impairment after stroke were compared. On the basis of \"disease differentiation, syndrome differentiation and meridian differentiation\", the syndrome differentiation and treatment system of mild cognitive impairment after stroke was preliminarily constructed, and the TCM syndrome prediction model was improved."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post-stroke Mild Cognitive Impairment"],"keywords":["Acupuncture therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"control group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: sham acupuncture"]},{"label":"treatment group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: electroacupuncture"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"electroacupuncture","description":"every time 30 min, 1 times a day, five times a week, 4 weeks for 1 course of treatment, treatment 3 period of treatment.","armGroupLabels":["treatment group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"sham acupuncture","description":"Electroacupuncture was connected to the fixed place of Sishencong on the left and right sides of Baihui and Shenting, and the electroacupuncture instrument was returned to zero.
