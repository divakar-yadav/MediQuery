During the study period, 5452 patients at intermediate risk for ischemic stroke or TIA will be enrolled from 100 centers.To evaluate whether probucol, as compared with placebo, reduces the risk of recurrent stroke in patients at high risk for ischemic stroke or TIA within 7 days of onset.Patients in one arm will receive probucol initiated with a dose of 1000 mg per day on days 1 through 30, and continuing with 500 mg per day after day 31, and those in the other arm will receive an equivalent placebo drug. Study visits will be performed on the day of randomization, at discharge, at day 90 and at 1 year and then followed up annually until the occurrence of the endpoint event or the end of the study. In addition, patients will be followed up at any time when new clinical symptoms of the neurologic system and suspicious events occur, including worsening of the original ischemic event and the appearance of new transient or persistent neurologic symptoms."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","TIA"],"keywords":["Probucol","Recurrent stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5452,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Probucol Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The study drug should be started as soon as possible within 7 days after symptom onset.","interventionNames":["Drug: Probucol"]},{"label":"Placebo Probucol Group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"The study drug should be started as soon as possible within 7 days after symptom onset.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo probucol"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Probucol","description":"Inclusion Days 1-30: Probucol 1000mg/day (500mg per dose, twice daily, a minimum of 4 hours should elapse between each pair of doses.)
