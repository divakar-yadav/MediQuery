The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of field-initiated TSC in improving the long-term functional outcome of subjects with acute stroke.\n\nSubjects with acute stroke will be identified and screened in the ambulance by (EMS) responders who have received training in basic and advanced cardiac life support, stroke recognition, and specific procedures relevant to the proposed study. The EMS responders will contact a Study Neurologist, who will enroll eligible stroke patients into the study. Effort will be made to obtain prospective informed consent in the ambulance when deemed to be feasible. If not feasible, subjects will be enrolled under regulations for exception from explicit informed consent (EFIC) in emergency research circumstances, after public disclosure and community consultation. Written informed consent to continue in the study is obtained from subjects or their legally authorized representatives as soon as possible after hospital arrival.\n\nEMS responders will deliver the single, field, bolus dose of study agent, TSC at 0.25 mg/kg or matched placebo, followed after hospital arrival by standard of care (SOC). No additional study drug will be administered in the hospital. Follow-up assessments will be performed at Emergency Department (ED) arrival, 24 hours, 48 hours, Day 4, Day 30, and Day 90. The study will be performed at up to 30 receiving hospital sites in Los Angeles County, CA, and central Virginia."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"TSC injections will be prepared and injected by unblinded personnel on each ambulance.
