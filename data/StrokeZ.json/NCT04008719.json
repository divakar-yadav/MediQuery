Baseline visit: after neurologic stability, 14 days or less after stroke and before discharge.\n2. First assessment :\n\n   1. Neurologic data: morphologic data (MRI of the brain), stroke severity (NIHSScore), aphasia assessment (Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination) if NIHS verbal score ≥1, hemineglect assessment (Bells test).\n   2. Personal data assessment :\n\n   i. Socio demographic : age, gender, marital status, employment, level of education ii. Medical history: medical treatments, psychiatric and non psychiatric history.\n\n   c. Psychiatric assessment i. Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview - depression ii.
