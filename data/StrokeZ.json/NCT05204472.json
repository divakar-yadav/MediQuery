Neuropathic facial pain (NFP) can arise after damage to or affection of the trigeminal nerve caused by trauma, infection or postsurgery and results in characteristic burning and shooting pain of the affected area in the face.\n\nThe lack of effective analgesic treatment for these two conditions continues to be an unmet medical need and led to the investigation of alternative treatments of CPSP and NFP such as deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is an invasive neuromodulation therapy that consists of placing small electrodes into confined anatomical structures of the brain to deliver small therapeutic currents.\n\nRecently, a modified stimulation paradigm has been developed in the field of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for a variety of neuropathic pain disorders. This so-called burst stimulation provides pulse trains of five high-frequency pulses at 500 Hz (= 500 Hz spike frequency) occurring 40 times a second (= 40 Hz burst frequency). Burst SCS has been demonstrated to provide a better pain relief compared to classical tonic (continuous application of 50 Hz stimulation) SCS without causing paresthesia. To date, this stimulation paradigm has not yet been evaluated systematically for deep brain stimulation to treat neuropathic pain disorders.\n\nThe purpose of this clinical investigation is to investigate if Burst-DBS of the thalamus is more effective compared to classical continuous low-frequency stimulation DBS to reduce the subjective pain intensity in patients with chronic neuropathic pain after stroke or in patients with neuropathic facial pain."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Central Post-stroke Pain","Neuropathic Pain"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Burst DBS first, Tonic DBS second","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"10 days of Burst-stimulation followed by 10 days of active tonic stimulation (Burst-DBS -\\> tonic-DBS)","interventionNames":["Device: Burst DBS","Device: Tonic DBS"]},{"label":"Tonic DBS first, Burst DBS second","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"10 days of active tonic stimulation followed by 10 days of Burst-stimulation (tonic-DBS -\\> Burst-DBS)","interventionNames":["Device: Burst DBS","Device: Tonic DBS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Burst DBS","description":"Patients undergo stereotactic implantation of DBS electrodes in the thalamus under local anesthesia.
