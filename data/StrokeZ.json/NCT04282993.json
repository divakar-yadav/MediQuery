Different risk factors have been identified such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoke, atrial fibrillation, obesity, and sedentary. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of an approach based on the use of wearable devices for the identification and reduction of risk factors in patients with previous history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Atrial
