Half the patients will undergo conventional therapy and half virtual reality training using virtual game. The study will also include healthy individuals matched for age, sex, schooling and hand laterality.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is the main cause of long-term disability in adults and motor learning is vital for recovering from motor sequelae. A number of approaches have been proposed to promote motor learning, including virtual reality, which simulates a real world environment and is based on the assumption that skills acquired in a virtual world will be transferred to the real world. Virtual reality induces use-dependent plastic changes in response to stimulation of higher motor areas, recruiting the memory system containing stored motor programs. As such, these interactive interventions of virtual reality are based on the idea that stimulating the action processing system activates the cortical areas involved in movement execution.\n\nThese game characteristics allow activation of the mirror neuron system during the execution or observation of actions. Recent evidence suggests an important role for this neuron system in the improvement or motor recovery of patients. In this respect, observing an action in association with physical training may enhance the effects of motor training on the recovery of patients with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke Sequelae"],"keywords":["Cerebrovascular disorders","Upper extremity","Paresis","Electroencephalography","Psychomotor Performance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Eighty unilaterally brain injured right-handed patients, with lesion time of 6 months or more, aged 70 years or younger, 40 with left-brain and 40 with right-brain injury, will take part in the study.
