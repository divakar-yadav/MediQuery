Therefore a fixed measure is inserted between admission and discharge. we have added a \"relatively\" fixed date at 6 months post stroke in order to see if change of function from specialized rehabilitation will differ in a longitudinal perspective, and if possible to see if the difference in time to admission (time from debut till admission in specialized rehabilitation)might influence results.\n\n3) description of psycho- social factors at 6 and 12 months post discharge"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke, rehabilitation, multidisciplinary, description"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":230,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"stroke patients","description":"specialized rehabilitation in a multidisciplinary team, Sunnaas International Network","interventionNames":["Other: rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"rehabilitation","description":"Description of specialized rehabilitation and Influence on activities, life satisfaction, psycho social aspects 6 and 12 months post discharge","armGroupLabels":["stroke patients"],"otherNames":["multidisciplinary specialised rehabilitation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"activities of daily living","description":"Changes in Activities of daily living are monitored as an indirect evaluation of how the specialized rehabilitation may influence patients' outcomes.","timeFrame":"patients will be followed 6 months from baseline testing"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Life Satisfaction checklist (LiSat-11)","description":"LiSat-11 consists of patients estimations of satisfaction with life as a whole as well as satisfaction in ten specific domains: vocation, economy, leisure, contacts, sexual life, activities of daily living (ADL), family life, partner relationship, somatic health, psychological health","timeFrame":"patients will be followed 6 months from baseline testing"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"National Institutes of health stroke scale (NIHSS)","description":"NIHSS is a clinical stroke assessment tool to evaluate and document neurological status in acute stroke patients.\n\nThe timeframe for discharge will vary with the different clinics since this is one of the differences expected.\n\nLength of stay is one of the outcomes","timeFrame":"patients will be tested baseline and at discharge"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale","description":"it is an evaluation of the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke","timeFrame":"patients will be followed 6 months from baseline testing"},{"measure":"Description of the psycho- social situation","description":"A semi - structured interview, with focus on the psycho-social situation 6 months after rehabilitation, will be performed.
