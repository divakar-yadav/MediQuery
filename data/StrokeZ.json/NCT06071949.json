Based on previous findings indicating the pain modulating effects of cannabinoids in chronic pain disorders, this clinical trial investigates the efficacy and tolerability of the THC-focused nano endocannabinoid system modulator AP707 in patients with chronic pain disorders due to central neuropathy of any genesis. Patients receive AP707 or placebo over the course of 14 weeks as an add-on to the standard of care. Changes in pain intensity, quality of life and sleep and others measures are monitored through different scales to assess the efficacy of AP707 in patients with chronic pain due to central neuropathy of any genesis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Pain","Pain Syndrome","Pain, Chronic","Chronic Pain","Chronic Pain Syndrome","Neuropathic Pain","Central Neuropathic Pain","Paraplegia","Multiple Sclerosis","Stroke","Phantom Limb Syndrome With Pain","Phantom Pain","Traumatic Brain Injury"],"keywords":["Adezunap","Pain Therapy","Pain","Pain Syndrome","Chronic Pain","Chronic Pain Syndrome","Central Nervous System","CNS","Neuropathic Pain","Central Neuropathic Pain","Paraplegia","Multiple Sclerosis","Stroke","Phantom Limb Syndrome with Pain","Phantom Pain","Traumatic Brain Injury","THC","Tetrahydrocannabinol","Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol","Cannabis","Cannabinoids"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":558,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Sublingual spray with maximum application of 16 actuations per day or a maximum daily dose of 17,6mg THC distributed over 4 daily intakes.","interventionNames":["Drug: Adezunap"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Sublingual spray with maximum application of 16 actuations per day distributed over 4 daily intakes.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Adezunap","description":"Sublingual spray with maximum application of 16 actuations per day or a maximum daily dose of 17,6mg THC distributed over 4 daily intakes.","armGroupLabels":["Treatment group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Sublingual spray with maximum application of 16 actuations per day distributed over 4 daily intakes.","armGroupLabels":["Control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in pain level on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS, 0-10) between baseline and at treatment week 14 (end of first treatment phase) in comparison of study arm 1 (verum) and study arm 2 (placebo)","timeFrame":"Once daily in week 4 and 14"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in the pain score of the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) questionnaire between baseline and at treatment week 14 in comparison of study arm 1 (verum) and study arm 2 (placebo)","timeFrame":"Week 1 and 14"},{"measure":"Change in pain level on the Numeric Rating Scale (0-10) between baseline and in treatment week 5 and 11 in comparison of study arm 1 (verum) and study arm 2 (placebo)","timeFrame":"Several times weekly in week 4, 5 and 11"},{"measure":"Responder analysis for endpoints 1) for treatment week 14","description":"1.
