of chinese traditional treatment in spasm after stroke,both in massage and herbal medicine bathing.","detailedDescription":"A Muti-center randomized controlled study with large samples to observe improvement of motor function,severity of spasm,ADL(activity of daily lives),by standardized protocols of TCM techniques(massage and herbal bathing) combined with conventional rehabilitation on spasm after stroke in 1 month.Modified Ashworth scale,Fugl-Meyer Index and Modified barthel Index were used for spasm,motor function and ADL.And also the follow up research within 3 months and 6 months focus on the efficacy duration of TCM on spasm.Try to find suitable timing for intervention on spasm by CTM(Massage and herbal medicine bathing)and the connection between spasm severity and treatment efficacy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Traditional Chinese
