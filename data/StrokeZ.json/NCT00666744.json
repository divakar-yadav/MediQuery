The first group or the experimental group will receive routine therapy and additional lower limb exercise therapy in the form of family assisted exercises. The second group or the control group will receive routine therapy with no additional formal input from their family members. A secondary aim of the project is to evaluate the impact of the FAME programme on the person with stroke and the individual (s) assisting in the delivery of exercises.","detailedDescription":"Participants with primary stroke eligible for inclusion to the study at 2 weeks post stroke will be randomised into either a 'control' group that will receive routine therapy or an 'experimental' group that will receive routine therapy AND additional 'family mediated exercise therapy.\n\nTraining will be provided to the nominated family member (s)/friends of participants in the 'intervention' group on a weekly basis by the research physiotherapist (R1). Family members/friends will be requested to keep an exercise diary on a daily basis to document completion of exercises. The trial will continue for eight weeks with an expectation that at least 1200 additional minutes of FAME therapy will be delivered over this time period. Each FAME session is expected to last 35-40 minutes.\n\nExercises will include repetitive sit to stand exercises with an emphasis on improving symmetry, weight bearing exercises during standing, bridging, straight leg raises, quadriceps strengthening exercises, active/active assisted range of movement exercises for the lower limb and walking. Outcome will be assessed by a blinded outcome assessor (R2) on entry to the study, at eight weeks (post-intervention) and again three months post-intervention (follow-up)\n\nIn addition, a semi-structured interview will be carried out with a random sample of the participants and their family member (s)/friends to gain a more qualitative insight into the impact of the programme on those involved. This interview will be completed by a person unknown to the participant.
