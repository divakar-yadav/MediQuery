Atherosclerosis is the main cause of ischemic stroke. According to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, the disease is closely related to the physical constitution of the individual. The main body constitution of the population in Lingnan area is phlegm dampness syndrome;Previous large cross-sectional studies have found that 65.3% of patients with ischemic stroke in Lingnan area have phlegm dampness syndrome. However, there is currently no biological evidence related to phlegm-dampness syndrome and ischemic stroke.In recent years, proteomics research technology has developed vigorously. The research samples have developed from blood obtained from minimally invasive to urine and saliva obtained non-invasively. Studies have found that urine proteins associated with AS include type I, type III collagen, 8-isoprostaglandin F2α, and saliva proteins include IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and PGE2.Therefore, this research is dedicated to exploring the biological basis of phlegm-dampness syndrome in patients with ischemic stroke using proteomics research techniques of urine and saliva."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Protein; Disease"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","phlegm dampness syndrome","traditional Chinese medicine","proteomic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Year","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"All the saliva and urine samples will be stored in the biological resource centre of the our research centre after written informed consent obtained from all subjects who voluntarily participated in this clinical study."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":400,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"A(healthy control group)","description":"patients who did not have ischemic stroke and whose TCM constitution was dialectically peaceful;"},{"label":"B","description":"Patients with no ischemic stroke and whose TCM constitution was dialectical with damp phlegm constitution"},{"label":"C","description":"patients with ischemic stroke diagnosed with phlegm dampness syndrome"},{"label":"D","description":"patients with ischemic stroke diagnosed as non-phlegm dampness syndrome"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Differentially expressed proteins of urine and saliva","description":"Proteomic expression of urine and saliva in each group will be tested use Protein liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry detection.","timeFrame":"1 day"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"NIHSS scoes","description":"NIHSS scoring scale for neurological impairment assessment","timeFrame":"1 day"},{"measure":"modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score","description":"mRS score for the degree of dependence","timeFrame":"1 day"},{"measure":"BI index","description":"BI index for living ability assessment","timeFrame":"1 day"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
