Because of its major impact on the general morbidity and risk of stroke, AF is a great concern for public health. Several mechanisms, including endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory processes, have been postulated as predisposing factors for AF, as well as for stroke.\n\nBoth clinical and experimental studies highlight inflammation as a predisposing factor for AF and its complications. Nevertheless, the source of high inflammatory proteins in patients with AF is still unknown. We hypothesized that multilevel intracardiac and extracardiac (left femoral vein, coronary sinus, left atrium, pulmonary vein) measurements of several inflammatory proteins (VEGF) would help assessing the extent and the source of inflammation in AF patients.\n\nThe measurement of von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels in multiple vascular sites would also help to define the site of endothelial dysfunction and of production of this thrombogenic factor.\n\nAlthough AF is associated with an increased risk of stroke, the risk is not homogeneous. Permanent and persistent AF are associated with similar thromboembolic risk to that of paroxysmal AF."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["atrial fibrillation","stroke","thromboembolism","inflammation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"atrial fibrillation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with atrial fibrillation","interventionNames":["Other: blood samples"]},{"label":"Control","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients without atrial fibrillation","interventionNames":["Other: blood samples"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"blood samples","description":"Patients with atrial fibrillation for whom electrophysiology exploration or ablation are programmed; All blood samples will be taken through the exploration catheter.
