The sample size of study was 40 post stroke patients who were diagnosed on physical findings and other investigation like CT and MRI. The inclusion criteria were set as post-stroke patients for more than 3 months with 20 and above score on MAS scale and age of 55 to 65 years, while the exclusion criteria were defined as participants having traumatic brain injuries, degenerative brain diseases, post craniotomy tumor patients leading to hemiplegia, patients having recurrent episodes of stroke, stroke patient with dementia and score on MAS scale below 20."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"virtual reality training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In intervention the participants took part in the VR training.
