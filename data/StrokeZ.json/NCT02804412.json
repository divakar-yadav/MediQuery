It has remained unclear, however, whether intensity of therapy or constraint is the relevant factor. This study will give an answer to this question to improve speech and language therapy.","detailedDescription":"Although there is clear evidence that aphasia therapy is effective, questions remain as to the intensity of administered therapy, the preferred therapeutic approach and its initiation with regard to stroke onset. CIAT is a a high intense group therapy administered over 2 weeks. Additionally, patients have to communicate solely in spoken words or sentences (constraint). This study compares CIAT with an approach of the same intensity without constraints and a less intense house-typical therapeutic approach."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia"],"keywords":["communication disorders","language and speech disorder rehabilitation","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients received a standard, house-typical aphasia therapy in single and group therapy sessions","interventionNames":["Other: Control group"]},{"label":"CIAT-group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients received constraint-induced aphasia therapy.","interventionNames":["Other: CIAT-group"]},{"label":"communication treatment group (CTG)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients received aphasia group therapy without constraints","interventionNames":["Other: communication treatment group (CTG)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control group","description":"This is the control group with 14 h treatment over 10 workdays.","armGroupLabels":["Control group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"CIAT-group","description":"Examine the efficacy of CIAT (30 h over 10 workdays) versus Control-group and communication treatment group.","armGroupLabels":["CIAT-group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"communication treatment group (CTG)","description":"Examine the efficacy of CTG (30h over 10 wokrdays) versus CIAT-group and control group","armGroupLabels":["communication treatment group (CTG)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of aphasia by Aachener Aphasia Test (AAT)","timeFrame":"pretreatment and within 24 h post intervention"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change of Communication Activity Log (CAL)","description":"The CAL is a two-part questionnaire rating the amount and the quality of daily communication on a six-point scale","timeFrame":"pretreatment and within 24 h post intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* first ever stroke\n* suffering from aphasia\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* severe cognitive or attentional impairments\n* severe depression\n* left-handedness\n* severe dysarthria\n* apraxia of speech\n* severe deafness\n* additional neurological diseases affecting speech (e.g. Parkinson's disease)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"39 Years","maximumAge":"89 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Hartwig Woldag, PhD","affiliation":"NRZ Leipzig","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"27506677","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Woldag H, Voigt N, Bley M, Hummelsheim H.
