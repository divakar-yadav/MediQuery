Half of the participants in the experimental group will be randomly assigned to the EEG-BCI (brain-computer interface) training (\"closed-loop\") group and will receive training on the BCI task along with muscle and tongue stimulation. The other half of the participants in the experimental group receiving traditional rehab will not receive any kind of FES or tongue stimulation for the first 8-10 weeks of study period and then will start receiving BCI-FES-tongue stimulation rehab therapy.\n\nAll participants without UE impairment in Control group 1 will receive 4-6 (minimum 4, up to a maximum of 6) sessions of training on the BCI system and pre- and post MRI and 2 behavioral testing sessions.\n\nAddition of a Control group 2 is consistent with the AHA grants - Twenty four ischemic stroke patients with moderate upper extremity (dominant right hand affected) impairment (score of 1 or 2 on the motor sub-component of the NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) and ARAT score 20-45); no upper extremity injury or conditions that limited use prior to the stroke; and pre-stroke independence with a Modified Rankin Score of 0 or 1), will be recruited in this arm. All participants in this group will receive MR sessions and behavioral testing similar to the Experimental group.\n\nAddition of an Experimental group receiving EEG-BCI-bilateral FES intervention using the recoveriX system: recoveriX is a brain driven rehabilitation system for stroke patients that pairs mental activities with motor functions. Through the EEG-based recoveriX BCI system, the brain receives visual and tactile feedback in real-time, making rehabilitation more effective. A stroke patient imagines a hand movement while receiving visual feedback through a virtual avatar, and tactile feedback through electrical muscle stimulation paired to the patient's imagined movement, with the aim that these patients might regain the volitional ability to grasp following therapy. Unlike the current EEG-BCI-FES intervention that involves stimulation of only the impaired arm, with recoveriX, both arms are simultaneously stimulated during the course of the intervention.\n\nSpecific Aims\n\nTo determine if functional muscle stimulation of the arms, in addition to non-invasive neurostimulation through the tongue (TDU), directed by electroencephalogram (EEG) output, can increase the extent of stroke recovery as measured by behavioral measures and induce brain plasticity as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\n\nPrimary objective\n\n* To examine the effect of EEG guided functional muscle stimulation on improvement in upper extremity function\n\nSecondary objective\n\n* To examine plasticity changes as measured by EEG/fMRI measures before and after EEG guided functional muscle stimulation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["aneurysm","transient ischemic attack"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":288,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental Group - Immediate BCI Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"EEG - BCI training (closed loop)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Behavioral Assessments","Other: Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Other: EEG","Device: BCI-FES"]},{"label":"Experimental Group - Delayed BCI Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Scanned and tested 4 times over a 10-week period before EEG-BCI training","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Behavioral Assessments","Other: Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Other: EEG","Other: Delay","Device: BCI-FES"]},{"label":"Experimental Group - RecoveriX","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Recruited from participants who have completed the study intervention","interventionNames":["Other: RecoveriX"]},{"label":"Control Group 1","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"48 stroke patients, 48 participants with risk factors for stroke, 48 healthy controls receiving 4-6 training sessions on the EEG-BCI, pre- and post- behavioral testing, and MRI","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Behavioral Assessments","Other: Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Other: EEG","Device: BCI-FES"]},{"label":"Control Group 2","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"24 Stroke Patients with UE impairment receiving standard FES only therapy","interventionNames":["Device: Functional Electric Stimulation (FES)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Functional Electric Stimulation (FES)","description":"FES uses low energy electrical pulses to artificially generate body movements in individuals with muscle paralysis.
