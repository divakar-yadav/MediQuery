Our hypothesis is that feedback-based rehabilitation will be more effective than standard rehabilitation for gait in older adults with gait disturbances. In this Phase II, we will use a pragmatic clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of Mobility Rehab on 300 patients with various types of gait disturbances in a physical therapy clinic. In addition to visual feedback, the system will be optimized in Phase II to also provide verbal feedback commands for patients during training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Parkinson Disease","Stroke","Multiple Sclerosis","Gait Disorders, Neurologic","Gait Disorder, Sensorimotor","Gait, Unsteady","Gait Ataxia","Gait, Stumbling","Gait, Shuffling"],"keywords":["gait","balance","falls","mobility","feedback"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Eligible participants are randomized into two groups.
