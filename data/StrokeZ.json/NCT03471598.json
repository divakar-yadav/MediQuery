Individuals with stroke often exhibit synergic pattern that disturb daily function. It is crucial to identify the movement impairment in the clinical settings. Upright Motor Control Test (UMCT) is one of the tests developed to assess the selective movement control and functional strength in people with central nervous disorders. It can be used to reflect the impairment of motor function and evaluate changes of performance after treatment. Yet is little to know the clinimetrics of the UMCT on clinical utility. To date, only few researches explore that UMCT has some construct and criterion validity.\n\nTherefore, this study aims to 1) establish the inter-rater reliability to administer the UMCT. 2) explore the correlation between the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery after Stroke (FMA) and UMCT. 3). investigate whether the UMCT is able to predict the walking ability in patients with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":67,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Upright Motor Control Test","description":"6-18; higher score means better isolated joint control.","timeFrame":"1 month"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery after Stroke","description":"UE scale:0-66; LE scale:0-34; higher score means better motor function.","timeFrame":"1 month"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"10 Meter Walk Test","description":"Test the time required to complete 10 meters of walking.","timeFrame":"1, 3, 6, and 12 month"},{"measure":"6-Minutes-Waking-Test","description":"Record the distance in six-minute walking.","timeFrame":"1, 3, 6, and 12 month"},{"measure":"Berg Balance Scale","description":"score: 0-56; lower score means higher risk of fall.","timeFrame":"1, 3, 6, and 12 month"},{"measure":"Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement Measure","description":"UE: 0-20; LE: 0-20: Mobility: 0-30; higher score indicated better motor function.","timeFrame":"1, 3, 6, and 12 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* First-ever, unilateral cerebral stroke within one month\n* Being able to maintain standing for more than 10 seconds\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Could not follow commands\n* Deformity or fracture of lower limb\n* Less than 20 years old","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Adults with first-ever, unilateral cerebral stroke within one month","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Bo-Jhen Chen","affiliation":"Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation","city":"New Taipei City","country":"Taiwan","geoPoint":{"lat":25.01111,"lon":121.44583}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
