Hemostatic consequences following device implantation will be evaluated using blood samples collected pre- and post-procedurally, and serially during three months follow-up in 135 LAAO patients. Platelet function and characteristics, overall activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway and the intrinsic contact activation pathway, as well as endothelial response to implantation, will be assessed through a wide range of biochemical analyses. Patients will serve as their own controls, with a final control blood sample collected at three-months follow-up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":135,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion","description":"Interventional left atrial appendage occlusion with the Amulet or Watchman device","otherNames":["Left Atrial Appendage Closure"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in coagulation activity","description":"Coagulation activity as measured by prothrombin fragment 1+2","timeFrame":"7 days, 14 days, 90 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in platelet activity","description":"Incl. platelet count, turnover, and aggregation","timeFrame":"7 days, 14 days, 90 days"},{"measure":"Additional measures of changes in coagulation and contact activation","description":"Incl. thrombin generation, fibrinogen, d-dimer and coagulation factors","timeFrame":"7 days, 14 days, 90 days"},{"measure":"Change in endothelial activation and response","description":"Incl. changes in soluble thrombomodulin, syndecan-1, selectin and von Willebrand factor","timeFrame":"7 days, 14 days, 90 days"},{"measure":"Non-procedural bleeding events","description":"As defined by the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium","timeFrame":"7 days, 14 days, 90 days"},{"measure":"Radiographical evidence of device endothelization","description":"On CT indicated by no contrast patency distal to the LAAO device.","timeFrame":"7 days, 14 days, 90 days"},{"measure":"Radiographically confirmed device-related thrombosis","description":"Defined as high grade HAT on follow-up cardiac CT or TEE","timeFrame":"7 days, 14 days, 90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age \\> 18 years\n* Atrial fibrillation (paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent)\n* Admitted and eligible for LAAO\n* Signed written consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Known hereditary bleeding disorders (i.e. Hemophilia A and B, Von Willebrand disease)\n* Platelet count \\< 75 x 109/ml","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Only patients already eligible for LAAO will be screened by clinical personnel and potentially recruited for participation.
