The primary focus of the proposed randomised pilot RCT is on recruitment and retention of patients in the intervention, and follow-up assessments. The researchers will also investigate outcomes associated with the intervention and the anticipated effect size for powering a larger trial, with a focus on the feasibility of implementing the intervention in a future definitive randomised controlled trial. The researchers will also carry out a study within a trial (SWAT), comparing recruitment and retention rates across acute, rehabilitation and chronic stroke settings.","detailedDescription":"Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in Ireland and worldwide. Many people are aware of the physical disabilities that occur following stroke, but are less aware of the cognitive problems that people experience. Cognitive problems, or cognitive impairment, include difficulties with thinking, memory and concentration. They affect up to 60% of people after stroke. Stroke survivors and their families describe cognitive impairment as one of the most difficult stroke outcomes to deal with, and the biggest obstacle to returning to pre-stroke life.\n\nRehabilitation of post-stroke cognitive impairment has received little attention compared with physical rehabilitation. Current evidence indicates that cognitive impairment continues to decline and - especially if the person has another stroke - develops into dementia, one of the main reasons people move to long-term, or nursing home, care (LTC). Intervening to rehabilitate cognitive impairment may halt further decline and/or improve cognitive function, thus improving quality of life, and preventing progression to dementia and LTC.\n\nThe StrokeCog research team has developed a cognitive intervention based on extensive review of international studies and in-depth consultation with people who have had a stroke, their family members, and healthcare professionals working with people following stroke. The researchers have already tested this intervention with a very small number of patients with stroke-related cognitive impairment. Working with patient representatives, this research programme seeks to further test this intervention with a larger sample of patients with stroke-related cognitive problems. The researchers will collect information on the best way to recruit patients into the study, how many complete the intervention, and examine initial results on the benefits of the intervention. The team will collect and analyse detailed information on the costs associated with delivering this intervention. The study will provide strong evidence on whether the intervention is worthy of further investigation in a larger-scale research trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke Sequelae","Cognitive Impairment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"The Research Fellow conducting neuropsychological assessments will be blinded to random allocation and will not be involved in delivering the intervention.
