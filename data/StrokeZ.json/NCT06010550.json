Over a 21-month period, approximately 600 subjects will be enrolled. The study will assess the risk of stroke in each patient using a machine-learning model. To detect ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, each patient will undergo a non-contrast brain magnetic resonance imaging study. The predictive performance of the machine-learning model will be evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dizziness","Vertigo"],"keywords":["Dizzy","Vertigo","Stroke","Machine learning"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":600,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dizziness/vertigo","description":"Patients aged 20 or above, presenting to the emergency department with dizziness or vertigo.","interventionNames":["Radiation: Magnetic resonance imaging"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"RADIATION","name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","description":"Brain magnetic resonance imaging","armGroupLabels":["Dizziness/vertigo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of participants with stroke","description":"Number of participants with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke confirmed by brain magnetic resonance imaging","timeFrame":"Between 24 hours and 14 days after the emergency department visit"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Presenting to the emergency department with dizziness or vertigo\n* Aged â‰¥ 20\n* Dizziness or vertigo lasting for at least 1 hour and \\< 7 days\n* Persistent dizziness or vertigo at the time of the examination at the emergency department\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Having 5 or more prior episodes similar in quality, intensity, and duration to the current symptoms, with at least one episode more than a year prior and one within the past year\n* Having frank stroke-like symptoms or signs, such as hemiparesis, facial asymmetry, dysarthria, dysphasia, ataxia, gaze palsy\n* Consciousness disturbance, Glasgow coma scale \\< 13\n* Severe dementia\n* Recent stroke within 3 months\n* Dizziness or vertigo thought to be the result of head injury, hypotension, medication/drug intoxication, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, anemia, hepatic encephalopathy, hydrocephalus, etc\n* Concomitant head or neck trauma\n* Severe degenerative cervical spondylosis\n* Having contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging examination","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Subjects who visit the emergency department.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Sheng-Feng Sung, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"886-5-2765041","phoneExt":"7284","email":"sfsung@cych.org.tw"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Sheng-Feng Sung, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Ditmanson Medical Foundation Chia-Yi Christian Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000014717","term":"Vertigo"},{"id":"D000004244","term":"Dizziness"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000015837","term":"Vestibular Diseases"},{"id":"D000007759","term":"Labyrinth Diseases"},{"id":"D000004427","term":"Ear Diseases"},{"id":"D000010038","term":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"},{"id":"D000012678","term":"Sensation Disorders"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7486","name":"Emergencies","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7110","name":"Dizziness","asFound":"Dizziness","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M17152","name":"Vertigo","asFound":"Vertigo","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M18077","name":"Vestibular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10469","name":"Labyrinth Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10472","name":"Labyrinthitis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7291","name":"Ear Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12651","name":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M15180","name":"Sensation Disorders","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC09","name":"Ear, Nose, and Throat Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
