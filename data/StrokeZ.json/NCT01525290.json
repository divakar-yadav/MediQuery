Objective of WAKE-UP is to prove efficacy and safety of MRI-based intravenous thrombolysis with Alteplase in patients waking up with stroke symptoms or patients with otherwise unknown symptom onset.","detailedDescription":"WAKE-UP is a clinical trial of MRI based thrombolysis in acute stroke patients with unknown time of symptom onset, e.g. due to recognition of stroke symptoms on awakening. Intravenous thrombolysis with Alteplase is available as effective and safe treatment of acute stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. However, in about 20% of acute stroke patients time of symptom onset is unknown. This large group of patients is currently excluded from treatment with Alteplase. The objective of the research proposed in the WAKE-UP project is to provide effective treatment options for this large group of acute stroke patients.\n\nWAKE-UP is designed to prove efficacy and safety of MRI-based intravenous thrombolysis with Alteplase in patients waking up with stroke symptoms or patients with otherwise unknown symptom onset. Patients will be enrolled based on MRI findings indicative of acute ischemic stroke less than 4.5 hours of age."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["wake-up stroke","thrombolysis","magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)","diffusion weighted imaging (DWI)","fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":501,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"intravenous tissue plasminogen activator","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention drug: intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), alteplase","interventionNames":["Drug: Alteplase"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Intervention drug: placebo","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Alteplase","description":"Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (Alteplase) 0.9 mg/kg body-weight up to a maximum of 90 mg, 10% as bolus, 90% over 1 hour as infusion","armGroupLabels":["intravenous tissue plasminogen activator"],"otherNames":["Actilyse","Activase","rt-PA"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"lyophilised powder to be reconstituted as solution indistinguishable from the active drug","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Efficacy","description":"Favourable outcome (Modified Rankin Scale 0-1)","timeFrame":"90 day after stroke"},{"measure":"Safety","description":"* Mortality\n* Death or dependency (Modified Rankin Scale 4-6)","timeFrame":"90 day after stroke"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Efficacy","description":"* Global outcome score\n* Responder analysis (Modified Rankin Scale 0, 0-1 or 0-2 depending on severity of symptoms assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on admission)\n* Outcome across all disability ranges (categorical shift in Modified Rankin Scale score)\n* Infarct volume (measured 22-36 hours after treatment)\n* Functional health status and quality of life\n* Use of health care system resources","timeFrame":"90 days after stroke"},{"measure":"Safety","description":"* Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (SICH) as defined in SITS-MOST\n* SICH as defined ECASS II\n* SICH as defined in NINDS\n* Parenchymal haemorrhage type 2 (PH-2)","timeFrame":"90 days after stroke"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nClinical Inclusion Criteria\n\n* Clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke with unknown symptom onset (e.g., stroke symptoms recognized on awakening)\n* Last known well (without neurological symptoms) \\> 4.5 hours of treatment initiation\n* Measurable disabling neurological deficit (defined as an impairment of one or more of the following: language, motor function, cognition, gaze, vision, neglect)\n* Age 18-80 years\n* Treatment can be started within 4.5 hours of symptom recognition (e.g., awakening)\n* Written informed consent by patient or proxy\n\nImaging Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute stroke MRI including diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) completed\n* MRI showing a pattern of \"DWI-FLAIR-mismatch\", i.e. acute ischemic lesion visibly on DWI (\"positive DWI\") but no marked parenchymal hyperintensity visible on FLAIR (\"negative FLAIR\") indicative of an acute ischemic lesion ≤4.5 hours of age\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nClinical Exclusion Criteria\n\n* Planned or anticipated treatment with endovascular reperfusion strategies (e.g. intra-arterial thrombolysis, mechanical recanalization techniques)\n* Pre-stroke disability (inability to carry out all daily activities, requiring some help or supervision, i.e. slight disability corresponding to an MRS score \\> 1)\n* Participation in any investigational study in the previous 30 days\n* Severe stroke by clinical assessment (e.g. NIHSS \\> 25)\n* Hypersensitivity to Alteplase or any of the excipients\n* Pregnancy or lactating (formal testing needed in woman of childbearing potential;
