The SAST trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aspirin in patients this enzyme disorder.The primary purpose of the trial is to evaluate the hemolytic effects of a 3-month regimen of aspirin 100mg/d versus a 3-month regimen of clopidogrel 75mg/d.","detailedDescription":"This SAST trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial.440 acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with G6PD deficiency will be randomized to receive a 3-month regimen of aspirin 100mg/d or clopidogrel 75mg/d. The primary end point is the proportion of protocol-defined hemolysis at 90 days. Protocol-defined hemolysis is defined as one or more of the following conditions: a) Hemoglobin level declined ≥2.5 g/dL from baseline, meanwhile ruling out bleeding events. b) Hemoglobin level declined ≥25% from baseline, meanwhile ruling out bleeding events. c) Clinically relevant hemolytic events, could manifested as fatigue, back pain, anemia, dark urine and jaundice.
