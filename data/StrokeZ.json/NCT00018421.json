Measurements of body composition at baseline and after training will further determine the effects of aerobic exercise training on muscle mass and central obesity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiplegia","Cardiovascular Disease"],"keywords":["Cerebrovascular Disorders","Exercise","Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Treadmill Exercise"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Males or Females Ages 40 yrs to 80 yrs who are chronic hemiparetic stroke patients.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"VA Maryland Health Care System","city":"Baltimore","state":"Maryland","zip":"21201","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":39.29038,"lon":-76.61219}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000006429","term":"Hemiplegia"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010243","term":"Paralysis"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9205","name":"Hemiplegia","asFound":"Hemiplegia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12847","name":"Paralysis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
