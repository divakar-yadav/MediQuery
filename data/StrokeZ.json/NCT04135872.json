Patients was identified as first-ever stroke based on past medical histrory. Admission CT was conducted to exclude hemorrhagic stroke, but not those bleeding transformation after ischemia injury. Baseline characteristics, including demographics, vascular risk factors, lab tests and neuroimagings were collected. Patients were followed up for cognitive assessments.","detailedDescription":"This is a perspective stroke registry cohort study. Stroke patients were included if ：(1) acute first-ever ischemic stroke and admitted within 72 hours after onset; (2) clinical stroke diagnosis was confirmed with positive diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), those with isolated posterior circulations infarcts were exclude ; (3) presented with mild stroke severity ( admission NIHSS score ≤5); (4) age between 40 and 80 years.\n\nClinical data including demographic characteristics, risk factors, and baseline NIHSS score were assessed and collected using a standardized table by experienced neurologists. Lab tests were performed with fasting venous blood samples within 18 hours of admission.\n\nPatients were followed up for 6 months. The cognitive functions were assessed using the Chinese version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).\n\nContributing factors to post-stroke cognitive impariment (PSCI) were determined by comparing clinical data between PSCI and non-PSCI groups. All potential confounders were introduced into the multivariate regression models."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cognitive Impairment","Stroke","Albumin; Double"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"6 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"fasting venous blood samples"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":435,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"hypoalbuminemia","description":"hypoalbuminemia was classified as serum albumin level (SAL) \\<35g/L","interventionNames":["Other: strengthened nuitritional treatment"]},{"label":"normal albumin level","description":"patients with serum albumin level (SAL) of 35g/L or higher"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"strengthened nuitritional treatment","description":"improving nutritional status by nasal feeding for dysphagia or iv. albumin when serum albumin level lower than 35g/L","armGroupLabels":["hypoalbuminemia"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"PSCI","description":"Patients with a MoCA score of \\<24 were categorized as having PSCI","timeFrame":"6 months post-stroke"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. acute first-ever ischemic stroke and admitted within 72 hours after onset;\n2. clinical stroke diagnosis was confirmed with positive diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), those with isolated posterior circulations infarcts were exclude ;\n3. presented with mild stroke severity ( admission NIHSS score ≤5);\n4. age between 40 and 80 years.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
