This trial was launched by Xuanwu Hospital, Capital University of Medical Science, with 40 collaborators participating. Enrollment will begin in 2013, and it aims to have a sample size of 840 subjects in 2 years. The trial is scheduled to complete in 2015.\n\nDetails:\n\nSAMMPRIS (Stenting vs. Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis) hasn't received the expected results; But, it does not mean that angioplasty with stent on intracranial treatment come to a full stop. On the contrary, a discrepancy on reported data between multi-centre RCT and most single center studies urges us for thorough investigation in future.\n\nAs we know, SAMMPRIS is flawed with defect in design, heterogeneity in experience and credentials of operators and high rate of complication; Some questions about SAMMPRIS have been raised, and remained unresolved.\n\nThis trial has been modified based on SAMMPRIS in order to acquire the data for China: Technique, experience, and credential of the operators are closely related with perioperative complications in PTAS. The investigators select 40 large-scale medical centers for participation on the basis of geographical distribution. All the participants are ranked as top in China. They have the most experienced surgeons or interventionist in China, and are fully qualified for this trial. This will guarantee the success and safety of technique, maintain the continuity of operator's experience, and make the complication rate as low as possible.\n\nSAMMPRIS was stopped ahead of schedule due to the safety concern. More than half of the PTAS patients were lost for follow-up at 1 year, and the remaining were followed up with a mean duration less than 1 year. It leaves the question of long-time follow-up data open. Base on SAMMPRIS, the investigators' trial will conduct a systematic follow-up system. Upon recruitment, all the patients' neurological and imaging examination will be determined at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months , 12 months after surgery, respectively."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","intracranial stenting","vascular risk factor management"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"12 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":840,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intracranial stenting group","description":"all the participants in this group will be performed with intracranial stenting","interventionNames":["Procedure: intracranial stenting"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"intracranial stenting","description":"all the participants in this group will be performed with intracranial stenting\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","armGroupLabels":["Intracranial stenting group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Ischemic stroke, death or cardiovascular events","description":"The participants who suffer from Ischemic stroke, death or cardiovascular events after enrollment or any revascularization procedure of the qualifying lesion in the territory of the symptomatic intracranial artery","timeFrame":"30 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Any stroke, or death","description":"the number of participants who suffer from any stroke(minor or major, ischemic or bleeding) or death","timeFrame":"beyond 30 days through 6 months"},{"measure":"the number of participants who suffer from restenosis (>50%) related to intracranial stenting","description":"the number of participants who suffer from restenosis (\\>50%) related to intracranial stenting","timeFrame":"up to 12 months"},{"measure":"the changes from baseline in mRS, national institutes of health stroke scale (NIHSS) and Barthel Index","description":"the changes from baseline in mRS, national institutes of health stroke scale (NIHSS) and Barthel Index","timeFrame":"at 7 days, 30 days, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 36 months"},{"measure":"the number of participants who survives in all patients","description":"the number of participants who survives in all patients","timeFrame":"beyond 12 months to 36 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Symptomatic status: as evidenced by TIA or non-severe stroke within the past 12 months attributed to 70% to 99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery (carotid artery, MCA stem \\[M1\\], vertebral artery, or basilar artery).\n* Degree of stenosis: 70%-99%; (Stenosis must be confirmed by catheter angiography for enrollment in the trial,WASID method)\n* Age:30-80 years;\n* No fresh infarctions identified on MRI (indicated as high signals on DWI series) upon enrollment\n* No massive cerebral infarction (\\>1/2 MCA territory), intracranial hemorrhage, epidural or sub-dural hemorrhage, and intracranial brain tumor on CT or MRI scan\n* mRS scale score of \\<=2\n* Target vessel reference diameter must be measure d to be 2.00 mm to 4.50 mm; target area of stenosis is \\<=14 mm in length\n* Patient is willing and able to return for all follow-up visits required by the protocol\n* Patient understands the purpose and requirements of the study, can make him/herself understood, and has signed informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Untoward reaction to anesthesia.\n* Any condition that precludes proper angiographic assessment or makes percutaneous arterial access unsafe.\n* Tandem extracranial or intracranial stenosis that is proximal or distal to the target intracranial lesion\n* Previous treatment of target lesion with a stent, angioplasty, or other mechanical device.\n* Any aneurysm proximal to or distal to stenotic intracranial artery.
