Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) has been shown to improve lower extremity spasticity of stroke patients. There are no researches to compare the efficiency of BTX-A injection by different guidance methods in the deep muscles of lower extremity for stroke patients. The aims of investigator's study were to compare the effectiveness of BTX-A injection by different guidance methods (palpation of anatomical landmarks, ultrasonography direct) in deep spastic muscles of lower extremity for stroke patients with varus spasticity and spastic claw toes , and to study the correlation between muscles spasticity and elastic properties by the sonoelastography/acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and follow the change of elastic properties in spastic muscles after BTX-A injection. We will enroll 80 hemiplegic stroke patients with varus spasticity / spastic claw toes and duration more than 6 months. Under different guidance methods (palpation of anatomical landmarks, electric stimulation, ultrasonography direct and indirect methods), BTX-A will be injected to the flexor digitorum longus and posterior tibialis muscles. If the patients have moderate hallucis spasticity, flexor hallucis longus muscle will be injected. The BTX-A dose is 50 units for each muscle. Outcome measures include Modified Ashworth Scale, Brunnstrom stage, muscle power, range of motion, the visual analog scale of pain, Stroke Impact Scale, Barthel index and lower extremity function tests, balance test, Goal Attainment Scale, sonoelastography and acoustic radiation force impulse imaging. All the assessments will be performed before BTX-A injection and followed up at 1 months, 2 months, 3 months and 6 months after injection. After performing all the assessments, investigator will investigate the efficiency of BTX-A by different guidance methods.","detailedDescription":"Stroke may result in lower extremity spasticity, which interfere with motor voluntary function and activities of daily living.
