The relationship between sleep disorders and vascular risk factors and stroke has been well-documented but not fully understood. The investigators hypothesize hemodynamics impairment to be its potential mechanism. It has been reported that sleep-related breathing disorder, a type of sleep disorders, contributed as a risk factor for stroke through hemodynamic and hematologic changes. The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between different kind of sleep disorders and cerebral hemodynamics, including OSHAS, RLS, RBD, narcolepsy, etc. The dynamic cerebral auto-regulation (dCA) and Transcranial Doppler (TCD) will be used to evaluate cerebral hemodynamics."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic"],"keywords":["Sleep Disorders","Cerebral Hemodynamics","Dynamic Cerebral Auto-Regulation","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"6 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"patients with sleep disorders"},{"label":"normal individuals without sleep disorders"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"phase difference(PD) in degree","description":"A dynamic cerebral auto-regulation parameter derived from transfer function analysis.Continuous cerebral blood flow velocities of bilateral middle cerebral artery will be assessed noninvasively using transcranial Doppler.
