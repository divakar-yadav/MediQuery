Subjects receiving antidepressant drug would be assigned to either active or placebo scalp electro-acupuncture treatment, on the hypothesis that acupuncture intervention combined with antidepressants could produce greater therapeutic effects than antidepressants alone.","detailedDescription":"Mood depression is a common and serious consequence of stroke. A large proportion of stroke patients develop post-stroke depression (PSD), either in the early or late stages after stroke. Although antidepressant agents, represented by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are recommended as first-line drugs in pharmaco-therapy of PSD, its effectiveness is limited and the clinical use is largely hampered due to broad side effects, especially on cardiovascular system. In addition, since stroke patients are often medicated with various classes of drugs, the addition of antidepressant agents may increase risk of drug-drug interactions, resulting in unexpected and unpredictable adverse events.\n\nThe objective of this proposed study is to determine whether electro-acupuncture (EA) combined with antidepressants could produce significantly greater improvement on depressive symptoms in patients with PSD compared to antidepressants alone.\n\nIn this 4-week, assessor-blind, randomized, controlled study of electro-acupuncture (EA) as additional treatment with the antidepressant drug called fluoxetine (FLX), a total of 60 patients with post-stroke depression (PSD) will be recruited. The patients will be randomly assigned to FLX (10-30 mg/day) combined with active cranial and body acupuncture (n =30) or FLX with placebo cranial and active body acupuncture (n =30) (12 sessions, 3 sessions a week). Changes in the severity of depressive symptoms over time are measured using depressive scale instruments. Clinical response and remission rates are also calculated. The study will be conducted at HKU School of Chinese Medicine, Tung Wah Hospital, and Kowloon Hospital, Hong Kong."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Depression","Stroke"],"keywords":["Acupuncture","Post Stroke Depression","Depressive Disorder","Cardiovascular Accident","Stroke","Apoplexy","CVA"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":43,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"DCEAS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Body electroacupuncture plus dense cranial electroacupuncture stimulation (DCEAS)\n\nFor those who were currently under antidepressant treatment, they would continue the existing treatment regimens.
