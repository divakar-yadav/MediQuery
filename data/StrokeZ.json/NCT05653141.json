This is a prospective longitudinal observational national monocentric study for 6 years (recruitment during the first 3 years). The investigators perform comprehensive neuropsychological testing in i) acute stroke phase (0-10 days post-stroke), ii) sub-acute stroke phase (3 months post-stroke), and iii) chronic stroke phase (12 months and 3 years post-stroke). At each time point, cognitive performances as well as clinical and functional status will be assessed. Furthermore, the investigators will assess the proxies of cognitive reserve and the level of post-stroke physical activity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["First-ever Ischemic Stroke","Cognitive Performance"],"keywords":["Ischemic stroke","Cognitive reserve"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Serum"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":335,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patients","description":"Adults with first-ever anterior circulation stroke"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of participants with delayed cognitive deterioration (DCD)","description":"The investigators will assess number of participants with deterioration of the cognitive performance in ≥2 cognitive domains on ≥ 1 Standard Deviation (1 SD).","timeFrame":"at 3 months, at 12 months and at 36 months post-stroke"},{"measure":"Number of participants with delayed functional deterioration","description":"The investigators will assess number of participants with deterioration of functional disability will be defined as decrease in disability level to one point assessed via modified Rankin Scale (mRS, 0-6, whereas 0=no functional disability).","timeFrame":"at 3 months, at 12 months and at 36 months post-stroke"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of participants with post-stroke cognitive impairment","description":"The investigators will assess number of participants with post-stroke cognitive impairment that is defined as at least moderate deficit (performance below -1.5 SD) in ≥ 2 cognitive domains.
