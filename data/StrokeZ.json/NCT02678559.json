These variations will be measured on preload dependency or preload independency status. The principal purpose is to determine if variations of stroke volume during standardized ARM can predict the preload dependency status.","detailedDescription":"Population studied: anesthetized patients for cardiac surgery of coronary bypass.\n\nSecondary endpoints : - comparison between TEE and mini-invasive monitoring systems in accuracy of measurement of stroke volume variation during ARM.
