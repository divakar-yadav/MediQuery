Focus of attention refers to whether individuals in are thinking about how their body is moving, internal focus, or on the effect their body has on the environment, external focus, during motor task. This trial will specifically look at the effect focus of attention has on motor performance and learning in individuals post stroke during lateral seated weight shifting task.","detailedDescription":"This was a two phase feasibility study exploring appropriate management, setting, participants including inclusion and exclusion criteria, attrition rates, protocol, and retention. Outcome data for each stage were collected during baseline, acquisition, short-term, and long-term retention.\n\nThere were two primary objectives of this two phase feasibility study. The first was to uncover some potential short comings in research designs used in this area. The second was to explore the feasibility of a study in both the chronic and acute stroke populations in a rural community. Topics of feasibility include recruitment, retention, and specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Extending the work by Muckel and Merholz, this feasibility study examined performance of individuals post stroke during a seated lateral weight shifting task and incorporated retention trials, quality of movement exploration, and bilateral weight shifting.\n\nDuring Phase I, individuals in both groups sat unsupported on a hi-lo mat table which was adjusted so participants were sitting at 90 degrees hip and knee flexion with feet shoulder width apart. Tape marks were used to mark initial set up ensuring standardized positioning for each trial. Following baseline trials, all participants watched the same instructional video describing lateral weight shifting. The instructions included correct mechanics that should be used when weight shifting laterally with focus on correct form needed for the movement.\n\nTesting included baseline, acquisition, short term retention (5 minutes later), and long-term retention (7-10 days later). Participants performed three trials of seated weight shifting to each side at all timepoints. During acquisition, the internal focus group was instructed to \"shift your weight as much as possible towards your right or left hip without using your arms\". The external focus group sat with targets one arm length away at shoulder height and were instructed to \"shift your body weight as much as possible towards the blue/orange target without using your arms.\" During baseline and retention trials, adults were instructed to \"lean as far as you can to the right/left without using your arms.\" During Phase II, the protocol was similar except 6 trials were performed for acquisition to potentially improve motor learning, which was not significant in Phase I per retention data. Other changes to the protocol included allowing participants to move their feet when weight-shifting. Instructions were also revised. The external focus group was told to \"move your shoulder as close to the blue/orange target as possible\", while the internal focus group was told to \"shift your body weight as much as possible towards your right/left hip without using your arms.\""},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Focus of attention","Motor learning","Seated weight shifting"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Two independent groups measured at 4 timepoints, baseline, acquisition, short-term, and long-term retention.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Participants were blinded from whether they were in control or experimental group and statistician was blinded.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":38,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Focus of attention in individuals post chronic stroke during seated lateral weight shifting","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Feasibility study","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Focus of attention"]},{"label":"Focus of attention in individuals post acute stroke during seated lateral weight shifting","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Feasibility study","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Focus of attention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Focus of attention","description":"Individuals were asked to laterally weight shift while seated with either internal focus or external focus instructions.","armGroupLabels":["Focus of attention in individuals post acute stroke during seated lateral weight shifting","Focus of attention in individuals post chronic stroke during seated lateral weight shifting"],"otherNames":["Seated lateral weight shifting"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recruitment","description":"Percentage of participants recruited out of the estimated number needed by power analysis.
