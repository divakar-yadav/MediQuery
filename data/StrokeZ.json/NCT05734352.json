Currently, there is no suitable PREM tool for patients with ischemic stroke. Therefore, we aim to develop and validate a PREM for this patient population. This PREM will be validated in a multicentre study, in 10 Flemish hospitals. We want to investigate the feasibility of our new questionnaire, as well as the usefulness. In addition we well analyse the results of the questionnaires and use this information to improve the quality of the care program for stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","description":"Completion of questionnaire","interventionNames":["Other: Questionnaire"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Questionnaire","description":"Completion of the patient reported experience measurements (PREMs) questionnaire","armGroupLabels":["Intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Validation of a new Patient Reported Experience Measurements (PREMs) for stroke patients","description":"Validation of a questionnaire which was developed based on literature and consensus meeting","timeFrame":"6-months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Patient experiences","description":"How do patients experience their received care when they are admitted to the stroke unit/neurology department","timeFrame":"6-months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* \\> 18 years\n* ischemic stroke\n* stayed at least one day at the stroke unit\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* not able to read the questionnaire\n* not able to answer question orally\n* are not proficient in the dutch language","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients with ischemic stroke","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"KU Leuven","city":"Leuven","state":"Flemish Brabant","zip":"3000","country":"Belgium","geoPoint":{"lat":50.87959,"lon":4.70093}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
