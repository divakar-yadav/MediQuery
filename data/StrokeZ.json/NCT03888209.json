This physiotherapy will be established 5 times a week (Monday to Friday).\n\nIn addition to physiotherapy, the patient will have electrodes placed on his head, attached via a system of straps, to deliver either a continuous current (A) or no current (P) and at a rate of 5 times per week for 4 weeks. Neither the physiotherapist nor the patient will know what treatment he will have received.\n\n• Evaluations and measurements:\n\nPatients will be required to perform functional tests of the upper limb (Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)), filmed and timed, a test of spasticity (Tardieu) as well as to answer certain questionnaires concerning their perception of the evolution of the disease and their disability (Stroke Impact Scale, Barthel Index), their emotional state (HADS), if they have experienced side effects, sensitivity test with monofilaments or Semmes and Weinstein test, the Fugl Meyer, the timed up and go, the test of 10m, the four step square test, the berg balance scale, the postural assessment scale and the trunk impairment scale. These evaluations will take place at Day 0 (corresponding to the first day after the 48h of strict bedtime), Day 7, 15, 30, 90, 6 months and 1 year. They will be done in two stages, on two successive days, so as not to exhaust the patient."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["tDCS","WMFT","Semmes Weinstein","Acute stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"randomized, triple blind, sham controlled","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"The device is preprogrammed by a third party non participating in any element in the study.
