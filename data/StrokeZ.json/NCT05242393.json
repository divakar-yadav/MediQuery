In the prospective longitudinal arm, about 200-250 patients admitted to the Stroke Unit of one participating center will undergo examination including the assessment of medical records, stroke characteristics, sleep characteristics and blood sampling for the evaluation of genetic biomarkers of circadian rhythms within the first 2-3 days after admission.The assessment of stroke severity and functional deficit will be repeated at 10-14 days after stroke.\n\nThe following associations will be assessed:\n\n* the association of genetic biomarkers of circadian rhythms with stroke outcome (the difference in neurological and functional deficit from admission to 14th day after stroke), with stroke characteristics (stroke subtype and neuroimaging stroke parameters) and with sleep characteristics.\n* the association of sleep characteristics with stroke outcome (the difference in neurological and functional deficit from admission to 14th day after stroke) and with stroke characteristics (stroke subtype and neuroimaging stroke parameters)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic","Sleep Disorder"],"keywords":["neuroplasticity","cognitive dysfunction","disability","circadian rhythm","functional deficit","stroke outcome","sleep-disordered breathing","heart rate variability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"whole blood, serum, saliva"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":250,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Retrospective cohort","description":"Patients with acute ischemic stroke admitted to the Stroke Unit of one participating center in 2018-2022.
