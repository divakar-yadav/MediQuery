The aim of the present study was to reduce prehospital delays in a population-based intervention.The intervention consisted of an educational letter indicating stroke symptoms and emphasizing the importance of calling the emergency medical services (EMS). The investigators additionally included a bookmark and sticker with the EMS telephone number. A total of 75,720 inhabitants received the intervention. Between 2004 and 2005, 741 patients with cerebrovascular events were admitted from the control areas (n=24) and 647 from the intervention areas (n=24).","detailedDescription":"Background and Purpose:\n\nIn patients with acute stroke, systemic thrombolysis needs to be administered within three hours of symptom onset. The aim of the present study was to reduce prehospital delays in a population-based intervention.\n\nMethods:\n\nWe performed a cluster-randomized trial with 48 zip code areas as cluster units in the catchment area of three inner-city hospitals in Berlin. The primary endpoint was time between symptom onset and hospital admission. The intervention consisted of an educational letter indicating stroke symptoms and emphasizing the importance of calling the emergency medical services (EMS). We additionally included a bookmark and sticker with the EMS telephone number. We fitted a lognormal survival regression model (time-to-admission) with frailty terms shared by inhabitants of the same zip code area."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["prehospital delays","intervention","population-based","stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1388,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Educational letter indicating stroke symptoms and emphasizing the importance of calling the emergency medical services (EMS) as well as a bookmark and sticker with the EMS telephone number.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: educational material"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"No intervention was performed"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"educational material","description":"Educational letter indicating stroke symptoms and emphasizing the importance of calling the emergency medical services (EMS) as well as a bookmark and sticker with the EMS telephone number.","armGroupLabels":["Intervention group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time between symptom onset and hospital admission","timeFrame":"Admission to hospital"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients with thrombolysis","timeFrame":"hospital stay"},{"measure":"Mortality","timeFrame":"hospital stay"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* All patients with stroke or transient ischaemic attacks from the postal code areas of the study being admitted to one of the participating hospitals\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with stroke or transient ischaemic attacks from outside the postal code areas of the study","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Stefan N Willich, MD","affiliation":"Institute for Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics","city":"Berlin","zip":"10098","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":52.52437,"lon":13.41053}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"16514090","type":"RESULT","citation":"Muller-Nordhorn J, Nolte CH, Rossnagel K, Jungehulsing GJ, Reich A, Roll S, Villringer A, Willich SN.
