These affect motor performance of the patients, as for example by impairing their walking capabilities and are responsible for long-term orthopedic deformities. Muscular structure influencing ankle and foot mobility are particularly evaluated in daily practice due to the major impact of muscle retraction on patients' mobility.\n\nDuring clinical examination, the evaluator searches the presence of the clinical markers of muscle retraction. However their clinical evaluation remains subjective and does not always allow to identify the precise location (which muscles) and origin (muscle contraction or retraction) of the observed response.\n\nIn that case, the sensitive nerve block (BNS)can complete the clinical examination. Its efficacy and selectivity are difficult to evaluate in a precise manner by a clinical examination on its own. Moreover, the possibility to predict the effect of a long-lasting spasticity treatment, like a botulinum toxin injection (ITB), from the effect of a BNS, has not been proven on the sural triceps muscle.\n\nThe study will use several evaluation techniques by biomechanical, neurophysiological and ultrasound (elastography) study which allow to quantify the response level within a muscle (measure of the muscle stiffness and retraction).\n\nThis study will take place within the rehabilitation and physical medicine department, patients are hospitalized or seen during stroke follow-up examination for uncomfortable sural triceps spasticity. They are evaluated by a quantified walking test, followed by a BNS, if the BNS result is positive, they are treated by a botulinum toxin injection in the sural triceps. The stiffness measurements before BNS (J0), after BNS (J0 post BNS) and after ITB (at day 28) will be standardized and additional instrumental examinations will be realized to understand the effects of the BNS and ITB procedure. The stretching will be performed by an isokinetic dynamometer and the muscle response to the stretching will be achieved by simultaneous evaluation of the response of the leg muscles by elastography and electromyography. In addition, clinical and neurophysiological data (exploration of nerve conduction on the tibial nerve) will be measured"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":27,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Biomecanical evaluation of the selective nerve block effects","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"D0 :\n\n* Information, collection of consent, inclusion,\n* Clinical and instrumental evaluation,\n* Realization of the selective nerve block,\n* Post-selective nerve block clinical and instrumental re-evaluation,\n* Performance of the botulinum toxin injection if indication selected.\n\nD28 (+/-5 days) :\n\n- Clinical and instrumental post-botulinum toxin injection evaluation.","interventionNames":["Other: Selective nerve block"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Selective nerve block","description":"D0 :\n\n* Information, collection of consent, inclusion,\n* Clinical and instrumental evaluation,\n* Realization of the selective nerve block,\n* Post-selective nerve block clinical and instrumental re-evaluation,\n* Performance of the botulinum toxin injection if indication selected.\n\nD28 (+/-5 days) :\n\n- Clinical and instrumental post-botulinum toxin injection evaluation.","armGroupLabels":["Biomecanical evaluation of the selective nerve block effects"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Biomecanical evaluation of the selective nerve block effects on soleus muscle stiffness (distal part) during stretching of the plantar flexor muscles in the patient after a stroke.","description":"Study of the soleus (distal) muscle stiffness before and after the realization of selective nerve block of the soleus nerve.
