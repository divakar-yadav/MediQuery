The procedure explores the use of the MAK exoskeleton during the static and dynamic rehabilitation sessions with the intention to evaluate the safety and usability of the device in the studied population. The protocol has been focused on defining how the device can be used appropriately in this population in a safe manner by rehabilitation specialists.The study also aims to assess the safety of clinicians implementing the intervention, as well as possible benefits derived from the use of the device. As a secondary outcome, efficacy measurements will be collected."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Gait, Hemiplegic"],"keywords":["exoskeleton","robotic device","gait assistance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The Intervention Group will receive 9 physical rehabilitation sessions using the MAK device.
