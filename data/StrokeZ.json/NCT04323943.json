This impairment, termed as \"foot drop\", is caused by an association of weak dorsiflexors and increased spasticity and stiffness of the plantar-flexors. As a consequence, walking performances are reduced and energy cost of walking is deteriorated. This may increase performance fatigability, as the locomotion will be realized at a higher percentage of the subjects' capacities. In order to overcome these issues, different treatments are proposed. One of the most conventional solutions are the use of ankle foot orthosis (AFO) and it is the most commonly prescribed device used to compensate for \"foot drop\". There is a very large choice of AFO on the market which can be proposed to patients with foot drop.\n\nThe aim of this study is thus to assess the mechanical effects of using a manufactured carbon AFO in by comparison to a custom-made thermo-plastic AFO on walking capacity (distance and energy cost), fatigue and \"foot drop\" control throughout the gait phase in patients with hemiparetic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiparesis;Poststroke/CVA","Gait, Hemiplegic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized, cross-over, open labelled, monocentric, controlled trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Carbon-AFO (C-AFO)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Manufactured carbon ankle foot orthosis (C-AFO) Sprystep (Thuasne) will be provided to patients.
