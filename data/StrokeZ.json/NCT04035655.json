Transcranial Direct Current stimulation (tDCS) is one of the few therapeutics that showed evidence of efficacy to increase level of consciousness and functional communication in some Minimally Conscious State (MCS) patients, and in some Vegetative State (VS) patients (1, 2, 3, 4), with no side effects reported.\n\nHowever the mechanisms by which tDCS improves consciousness are poorly understood and the electrophysiological effects of the stimulation have never been studied in disorders of consciousness patients.\n\nIn this study, the investigators will use detailed clinical examinations (Coma Recovery Scale - Revised (5)) and electrophysiological assessments (quantitative high-density EEG and event-related potentials) (6, 7) and event-related potentials (8, 9) together with a standard morphological MRI to assess the effect of a open-label single session of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tDCS stimulation administered as routine care.\n\nThe primary goal is to investigate electrophysiological response to tDCS and its relation to behavioral response to better understand how tDCS affects consciousness in disorders of consciousness patients.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
