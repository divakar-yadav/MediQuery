Among various sequalae, dysphagia can be observed in about 40% -60% of post-stroke patients and 20% -30% of them might suffer from recurrent aspiration pneumonia and may inhibit recovery and can even lead to death. Recovery after brain lesions can be explained by specific molecular events. It is proven that Genetic polymorphisms associated with impaired neural repair or plasticity might reduce recovery from stroke. Not only for the motor recovery, but genetic polymorphism is also crucial for the recovery of swallowing after stroke, however, only limited amount of studies are available. Therefore, it is urgent to determine whether the recovery of swallowing disorders after stroke is affected by the inherent polymorphism of the patient, whether the degree of recovery and brain plasticity associated with swallowing depend on the gene characteristics and polymorphism of the patient and whether recovery in swallowing parallel to the recovery observed in other functional areas (ie. hand recovery, truncal control recovery, ADL recovery).\n\nBased on the results of this study, results will be expected to help provide genetically tailored diagnosis and prognostication according to the gene polymorphism of the patient. Optimized treatment of the patient is expected to contribute to prevention of respiratory complications and improve functional outcome related to swallowing after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Dysphagia"],"keywords":["gene polymorphism","stroke","dysphagia","poststroke recovery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Blood serum analysis"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":220,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dysphagia patients","description":"Patients who had been diagnosed with neurogenic dysphagia related to either stroke or traumatic brain injury at two university affiliated hospitals"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Functional Oral Intake Scale(FOIS)","description":"Functional oral intake scale(FOIS) is categorical scale range from 1 indicating severe dysphagia and 7 indicating safe oral feeding.

The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions.
