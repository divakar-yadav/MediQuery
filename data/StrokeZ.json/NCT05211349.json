Unidimensional scales (DTUG, 3MBWT) can be useful in clinical practice and in screening for basic balance problems. Two balance assessment tools that have been used recently have attracted considerable attention: the Dual-Task Timed Up and Go Test (cognitive) (DTUG) and the 3-m Backward Walk Test (3MBWT). The aim of this study is to compare the psychometric properties of two clinically proven balance assessment tools. In the study, construct validity, concurrent validity, reliability, and cut-off score (for determining falling risk) of the two tests will be calculated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Falling","Reliability and Validity","Postural Balance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Dual-Task Timed Up and Go Test (cognitive)","description":"It evaluates balance with a simultaneous cognitive and motor task.
