The investigators will use the following study design: a pilot study with 10 ICU patients receiving CPM and 10 matched cases which will follow a conventional physiotherapy program at the time of the conduction of the study. The comparison between the treatment and referent groups of the outcomes will prove the prophylactic power of CPM against HO.","detailedDescription":"The aim of this study is to formally evaluate whether the investigators can indeed prevent HO by the timely and painless use of CPM in neurogenic intensive care unit (ICU) patients with stabilized medical conditions, suffering from neurological insults either traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, or Spinal Cord Injury (SCI). The investigators hypothesize that HO formation can be suppressed if CPM can be performed for a substantial amount of time. The investigators will perform a pilot study with 10 ICU patients receiving CPM and 10 matched cases which will follow a conventional physiotherapy program at the time of the conduction of the study. The primary outcomes will be the CT appearance of HO in the hip or knee joint and the degree of ROM limitation in the given joint at baseline and at the end of the clinical trial. A secondary outcome that will be measured, will be the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) at the beginning and at the end of the CPM program. The comparison between the treatment and referent groups in terms of these outcomes will prove the prophylactic power of CPM against HO."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Traumatic Brain Injury","Spinal Cord Injuries","Stroke"],"keywords":["Ossification, Heterotopic","continuous passive motion (CPM)","zoledronic acid","range of motion (ROM)","PROPHYLAXIS"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"randomized control trial","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"CT will not reveal the group of patient's origin to the reader","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Continuous passive motion (CPM)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"10 ICU patients receiving CPM at HO joints that continuously stretches slowly the joint passively at a constant velocity in a painless range and for a substantial amount of time until there is evidence both laboratory (bone alkaline phosphatase) and radiographically (CT), that osteogenesis has entered a quiescent state.
