The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is it feasible for stroke survivors with aphasia to participate in a long in-person physical exercise program?\n* Does participation in a physical exercise program lead to physical fitness, cognitive, language and/or psychological changes?\n\nParticipants can take part in two different physical exercise interventions:\n\n* Low intensity intervention (control intervention);\n* High-intensity physical exercise intervention (target intervention)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia, Acquired","Aphasia","Aphasia, Fluent","Aphasia Non Fluent"],"keywords":["aphasia","physical exercise","high intensity interval training","cognition","physical fitness","balance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"As this is a feasibility study, participants can choose to participate in just one or both types of physical exercise interventions.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Low-intensity physical exercise","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The participants will participate in a low-intensity non-aerobic exercise program for 2 weeks.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Low-intensity physical exercise"]},{"label":"High-intensity physical exercise","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The participants will take part in a high-intensity Aphasia Physical EXercise (APEX) intervention designed specifically for individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia for 8 weeks.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: High-intensity physical exercise"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Low-intensity physical exercise","description":"As an active control intervention, a low-intensity non-aerobic exercise program was selected that mirrors more closely the standard-of-care physical therapy currently provided to stroke patients.

Maximal Aerobic Capacity (VO2 Max) is the ability of the body to utilize oxygen to produce energy and is measured via a graded exercise test until volitional fatigue, while measuring consumption of oxygen with a computerized metabolic system. Typically measured on a treadmill, VO2 Max has also been found to be accurately and safely measured in stroke survivors on a recumbent stepper, which will be used in this study. A good VO2max varies greatly depending on age, and for older participants is typically between 30-40 ml/kg/min (higher values indicate greater fitness).","timeFrame":"Baseline and immediately after the intervention (3rd week for the low-intensity arm and 9th week for the high-intensity arm)"},{"measure":"Attendance","description":"Total number of physical exercise classes attended during the intervention.","timeFrame":"After the intervention (3rd week for the control intervention and 9th week for the experimental intervention)"},{"measure":"Change on the 30-second chair stands","description":"The number of full stands from a seated position that can be completed in 30 seconds with arms folded across the chest.","timeFrame":"Baseline and immediately after the intervention (3rd week for the low-intensity arm and 9th week for the high-intensity arm)"},{"measure":"Change on the 2-minute Step Test","description":"The number of knee raises completed in 2 minutes, raising each knee to a point midway between the patella (kneecap) and iliac crest (top hip bone).","timeFrame":"Baseline and immediately after the intervention (3rd week for the low-intensity arm and 9th week for the high-intensity arm)"},{"measure":"Change on the Timed Up-and-Go Test","description":"The number of seconds it takes to get up from a seated position, walk 3 m, turn, and return to a seated position.","timeFrame":"Baseline and immediately after the intervention (3rd week for the low-intensity arm and 9th week for the high-intensity arm)"},{"measure":"Change on the Functional Reach Test","description":"The number of inches reached forward with each arm with feet flat on the floor at hip width.","timeFrame":"Baseline and immediately after the intervention (3rd week for the low-intensity arm and 9th week for the high-intensity arm)"},{"measure":"Change in Gait Speed","description":"The speed in meters per second for the middle 6 m of the 10 m walkway.","timeFrame":"Baseline and immediately after the intervention (3rd week for the low-intensity arm and 9th week for the high-intensity arm)"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change on the Philadelphia Naming Test (PNT)","description":"Aphasia naming test to assess word retrieval abilities.
