The experimental group (EG) receives an arm-hand boost program on top of their usual care program. The control group (CG) receives a dose-matched program of strengthening exercises for the lower limbs and general reconditioning. After 4 weeks, a cross-over is performed. Before, after 4 weeks and after 8 weeks of additional therapy, different clinical outcome measures for the upper limb are administered."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm-hand BOOST + Control","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"First 4 weeks arm-hand boost program, afterwards, 4 weeks of control program","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Arm-hand BOOST program","Behavioral: Control program"]},{"label":"Control + Arm-hand BOOST","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"First 4 weeks control program, afterwards 4 weeks arm-hand boost program","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Arm-hand BOOST program","Behavioral: Control program"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Arm-hand BOOST program","description":"The arm-hand boost program is provided 1 hour/day, 5x/week for 4 weeks, on top of their usual care program.
