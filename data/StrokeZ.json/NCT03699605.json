To determine the efficacy of VESMP in improving the quality of life and level of satisfaction of aphasic stroke patients.Control group received traditional therapy and experimental group received therapy through VESMP programme on their smart phones.","detailedDescription":"Speech therapy makes an integral part of the non-pharmacological, conservative management of Post stroke aphasia. Routine speech therapy aims to improve comprehension and verbal skills and also develop functional communication skills through augmentative Alternative communication devices. Disorders of communication, including aphasia (mainly post stroke) caused by the left hemisphere brain damage, is a major community health issue. Aphasia is a language disorder occurring mainly as a result of stroke. It is an acquired impairment of language that weakens people's ability of comprehension and expression, it does not show any affect to intellect ability. The verbal expressive skills management programme (VESMP) is the software which developed augmented management for patients to enhance verbal expressive skills for patients with severe Broca's aphasia from different geographic areas."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia, Broca","Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Aphasia","Broca Aphasia","communication skills","Verbal expressive skill management programme"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The two groups were included for speech therapy.
