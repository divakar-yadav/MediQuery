Participants are assessed with videofluoroscopy at the initiation of the study and after each week of the study. After the 4 weeks of participation are complete, all participants will be discharged from treatment and will be brought back to the clinic for a final Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS) evaluation after 2 weeks. This means that individuals in Group 1 will be re-analyzed after 1 month of additional no-treatment, and Group 2 will be re-analyzed after 2 additional weeks of no-treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Dysphagia"],"keywords":["Deglutition Disorders","Mendelsohn Maneuver","SEMG"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Within subjects treatment, no-treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Within subject, treatment and no-treatment periods.
