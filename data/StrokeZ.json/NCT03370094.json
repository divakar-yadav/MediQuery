Interactive video and audio streaming connecting on-site paramedics to a stroke center based stroke physicians can help to overcome these hurdles. Patient evaluation by simple, pre-defined assessment measures and a standardized questionnaire may enable a pre-hospital decision on the need of expedited diagnostic and treatment procedures after arrival at the dedicated stroke center."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":117,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"patients with suspected stroke","description":"patients with suspected stroke due to paramedic's initial evaluation of face, arm, and speech function will be diagnosed with audio-video-streaming of suspected stroke symptoms and signs","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Audio-video-streaming of suspected stroke symptoms and signs"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Audio-video-streaming of suspected stroke symptoms and signs","description":"The diagnosis based on the patient evaluation by end-to-end encrypted real-time video will be compared to the gold standard, consisting of an in-person neurological examination by a stroke specialist in patients with suspected acute stroke.","armGroupLabels":["patients with suspected stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Diagnostic accuracy of the patient evaluation by remote Audio/video session","description":"The proportion of successfully realized 'telestroke' interviews (=patient has a stroke yes/no) in comparison to final diagnosis by the caring stroke team.","timeFrame":"1 hour"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Diagnostic accuracy of an automated biometric software","description":"The proportion of correct stroke diagnosis by the automatic biometric assessment compared to the final diagnosis of the caring stroke team.","timeFrame":"12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any patient older or equal than 18 years with suspected acute stroke as per the first judgement of the paramedics on-site.\n* written informed consent by the patient, or legal representative (next-of kin) or informed consent by an independent physician not involved in the study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n-patients with symptoms not attributable to stroke in the emergency onsite ( observation of epileptic seizure, recent cerebral trauma, prior syncope or comatose state)","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"The current phase of the project (\"Feasibility\") will include patients with suspected acute stroke already admitted to the ER of the University Hospital Basel, and patients with suspected acute stroke and who are referred to the Stroke Center of USB by the paramedics.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Philippe Lyrer","affiliation":"University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University Hospital","city":"Basel","zip":"4031","country":"Switzerland","geoPoint":{"lat":47.55839,"lon":7.57327}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
