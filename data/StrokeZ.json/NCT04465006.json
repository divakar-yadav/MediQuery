Patients were divided into two groups as hippotherapy simulator group (HSG) (n = 13) and conventional exercise group (CEG) (n = 13). Patients were evaluated with Berg Balance Scale (BBS) for balance, Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke (PASS) for postural control, Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI), and Time Up- Go Test (TUG) for mobility, 2min. Walking Test (2mWT) for functional capacity and Barthel Index (BI) for the level of independence respectively before and after treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Hippotherapy","Cerebrovasculer disorders","Stroke Rehabilitation","Balance","Exercise"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"One group received hippotherapy exercise, while the other group received conventional exercise.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":26,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hippotherapy Simulator Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Getting a diagnosis of stroke by a specialist physician, Being between the ages of 18-65, Having a stroke history of 3- 36 months, To be able to sit without support while both soles are in contact with the floor, To be able to walk independently with or without using walking aid, To be able to understand and follow audio and visual warnings, Scoring 24 points or more from the Mini Mental State Exam.","interventionNames":["Other: Hippotherapy Simulator"]},{"label":"Conventional Exercise Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Getting a diagnosis of stroke by a specialist physician, Being between the ages of 18-65, Having a stroke history of 3- 36 months, To be able to sit without support while both soles are in contact with the floor, To be able to walk independently with or without using walking aid, To be able to understand and follow audio and visual warnings, Scoring 24 points or more from the Mini Mental State Exam.","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional Exercise"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Hippotherapy Simulator","description":"Patients in the hippotherapy simulator group received 30 sessions of treatment for 6 weeks, 5 days a week and 1 hour a day. 45 minutes of Neurodevelopmental treatment exercises and 15 minutes of hippotherapy simulation exercise program were applied to the participants in this group.","armGroupLabels":["Hippotherapy Simulator Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional Exercise","description":"Patients in the conventionnal exercise group received 30 sessions of treatment for 6 weeks, 5 days a week and 1 hour a day. 60 minutes of Neurodevelopmental treatment exercises were applied to the participants in this group.","armGroupLabels":["Conventional Exercise Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Berg Balance Scale","description":"The Berg balance scale is used to objectively determine a patient's ability (or inability) to safely balance during a series of predetermined tasks.
