MeCFES-assisted rehabilitation will be compared with usual care rehabilitation of upper limb. It is hypothesized that that applying MeCFES in rehabilitation to assist normal arm movements during rehabilitation of the upper limb in persons with stroke will improve the movement quality and success and thus induce recovery at the body functions level (impairment) and the activity level (disability) of the International Classification of Function (ICF) superior to that induced by usual care rehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Functional Electrical Stimulation","Cerebrovascular accident","Stroke","Electromyography"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":82,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MeCFES","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"25 daily sessions (45 minutes each) of MeCFES-assisted task-oriented upper limb rehabilitation","interventionNames":["Device: MeCFES-assisted task-oriented upper limb rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"25 daily sessions (45 minutes each) of usual care task-oriented upper limb rehabilitation","interventionNames":["Other: Usual Care task-oriented upper limb rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"MeCFES-assisted task-oriented upper limb rehabilitation","armGroupLabels":["MeCFES"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Usual Care task-oriented upper limb rehabilitation","armGroupLabels":["Control"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change Score of ARAT Scale Between Two Time Points: Post-treatment vs Pre-treatment","description":"ARAT: Action Research Arm Test scale (15 item) (see in References section: Van der Lee JH et al 2002).\n\nARAT minimum value is 0 and maximum value is 45.
