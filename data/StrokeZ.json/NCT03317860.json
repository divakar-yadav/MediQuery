This study will examine the preliminary effects of an innovative intervention (repetitive task-specific practice + transcranial direct current stimulation) for individuals with neglect. This study will also determine whether items from various neglect assessments can be combined to establish a more comprehensive neglect measure.","detailedDescription":"It is very common for stroke survivors to have difficulty attending to one side of their body or space (neglect). Stroke survivors with neglect not only demonstrate impairments in attention but they also experience motor impairment. These individuals also have an imbalance in excitation in the brain. This study will examine the preliminary effects of non-invasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation, tDCS) combined with arm rehabilitation training (repetitive task-specific practice, RTP) for individuals with neglect following stroke. The investigators will examine the effects of the intervention on brain excitability, upper extremity motor impairment, and attentional impairment. This study will also examine assessment of neglect. There are many clinical assessments designed to assess neglect; however, it is unknown whether items from some of the most commonly used assessments are able to effectively measure neglect or whether items from these assessments can be combined. Clinicians rely on clinical assessments to inform treatment and document patient progress. Therefore, it is important that investigators more closely examine these existing assessments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["perceptual disorders","cerebrovascular disorders","neurobehavioral manifestations","neurologic manifestations","neglect","non-invasive brain stimulation","rehabilitation","tDCS","paresis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","maskingDescription":"Participants will receive both conditions (active and sham transcranial direct current stimulation paired with arm rehabilitation training \\[repetitive task-specific practice\\]) in this cross-over design study. Individuals will be randomized to determine which condition they receive first and the participant and treatment therapist and assessor will be blinded to the order that the interventions are delivered. The PI will oversee randomization so that each patient is randomized and assigned a unique five digit code. When this code is entered on the tDCS device, the device will automatically assign the patient to receive either real or sham stimulation. Because the sham stimulation provides a ramp up/ramp down stimulation for 15 seconds at the start and end of the session the participant may perceive the sham stimulation as active stimulation.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":17,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sham tDCS plus RTP","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Single session of bilateral sham parietal cortex tDCS (for 30 minutes) paired with repetitive task-specific practice (RTP)","interventionNames":["Device: Sham tDCS"]},{"label":"Active tDCS plus RTP","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Single session of bilateral active parietal cortex tDCS (2.0 mA for 30 minutes) paired with repetitive task-specific practice (RTP)","interventionNames":["Device: Active tDCS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham tDCS","description":"Sham tDCS will be delivered for 30 minutes in conjunction with repetitive task-specific practice for the arm/hand. tDCS is a form of noninvasive brain stimulation.
