Anecdotal evidence from a phase I trial investigating the use of CBD for medically refractory seizures suggests CBD may also have a beneficial effect on cognition, mood, and behavior. The investigators hypothesize that CBD/ Epidiolex will improve SWS brain function resulting in improved cognitive function, social interactions, mood, motor function and behavior, as well as reduced migraines. This is an open-label prospective oral drug trial of Epidiolex in 10 subjects. Assessments will be done at baseline and repeated after 6 months on study drug."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sturge-Weber Syndrome"],"keywords":["Sturge-Weber Syndrome","SWS","Cognitive impairments"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":11,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cannabidiol/ Epidiolex","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All subjects will receive the experimental Epidiolex (cannabidiol) oral solution to be taken at home twice a day, and will be treated on an outpatient basis.
