Statins prolong time to arterial thrombosis in endothelial injury model, inhibit P-selectin expression and platelet aggregation, reduce platelet PAR-1 thrombin receptor, and reduce tissue factor levels in plasma, its expression on monocyte surface, and atherosclerotic plaques. Second, statins enhance thrombolysis. They reduce PAI-1, increase t-PA activity and reduce fibrinogen level. Combined treatment of statins and t-PA in rats reduces the infarct size and downregulates expression of tissue factor, ICAM-1, vWF, and MMP-9. In addition, t-PA induced toxicity is reversed by statins.\n\nThird, statins have anti-inflammatory actions that can stabilize and even regress plaques. Statins reduce the number of T-lymphocytes within plaques, inhibit migration and activation of monocyte/macrophage system, and reduce matrix metalloproteinase activity that play a critical role in plaque rupture. Rosuvastatin 40 mg could regress coronary atheroma burden at 2 years, and reduce progression of carotid intima-media thickness.\n\nBenefits of statins in stroke patients are partially proven!\n\nFirst, statins are well known to be effective in primary prevention of stroke. Second, statins were effective in secondary prevention of stroke. A high dose of statin (atorvastatin 80 mg) reduced recurrent stroke in patients with recent TIA or ischemic stroke when it was administrated 1-6 months after stroke onset. However, it is uncertain whether statins are effective during the first month after stroke. Third, outcomes are better in patients under statin treatment at the moment of stroke. Patients pretreated with statins showed better survival, less severe neurologic deficits, and improved outcomes when they were treated with thrombolysis.\n\nHowever, it is unknown whether statin treatment in stroke patients is effective when it is administrated during the acute stage.\n\nBased on strong supportive evidence in human and experimental animals which support theoretical superiority of rosuvastatin, this study will test a hypothesis that a high dose of rosuvastatin is effective in preventing recurrence during the first month after onset in ischemic stroke patients and should be given to all patients from their onset."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Additional relevant MeSH terms","Stroke","Cerebral Infarction","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Recurrence"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":318,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Rosuvastatin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Rosuvastatin 20mg tablet, once daily, for 14 days","interventionNames":["Drug: Rosuvastatin"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo tablet, once daily, for 14 days","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo tablet"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Rosuvastatin","description":"Rosuvastatin 20mg tablet, once daily, for 14 days","armGroupLabels":["Rosuvastatin"],"otherNames":["Crestor 20mg"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo tablet","description":"Placebo tablet, once daily, for 14 days","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Presence Of Newly Developed DWI Lesions","description":"The objective would be to Compare the recurrence rate of ischemic strike by comparing the PRESENCE of newly developed DWI between baseline and after 14 days of treatment.","timeFrame":"During 14 days of treatment"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Volume Of DWI Lesions With Percent Improvement Of NIHSS Score","description":"1.
