It is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in many countries.\n\nStroke is broadly classified into ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemic stroke is more common than hemorrhagic stroke. In Indonesia, the prevalence of ischemic stroke is 42.9% compare to hemorrhagic stroke 19.9%. Ischemic stroke defined as an episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal cerebral, spinal, or retinal infarction.\n\nOne of the main therapy in ischemic stroke is administration of anti thrombotic agent. DLBS1033 is a bioactive protein fraction isolated from Lumbricus rubellus. DLBS1033 possessed quadruple activities that inhibit platelet aggregation, induces fibrinogenolysis, fibrinolysis, and thrombolysis. This is a new proposed medication nowadays. There is still a limited study about DLBS1033. To our knowledge, research concern on the usage of DLBS1033 in stroke patients is very limited in Indonesia. This study aimed to Measure the benefit of DLBS1033 as add on therapy for ischemic stroke patients.\n\nThe hypothesis of this study :\n\na. The use of DLBS1033 improve functional status of ischemic stroke patients at hospital discharge. b. The use of DLBS1033 improve functional status 30-days after stroke onset.","detailedDescription":"This was randomized, controlled, open-label, study from the period of April 2020 - August 2020 at Bethesda Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.\n\nThere were 180 acute ischemic stroke patients who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Each subject recruited from acute stroke intensive care unit had been followed up from the first day they were hospitalized until hospital discharge (died or discharged alive) and 30 days after the onset.\n\nEthical approval number 1087/C.16/FK/2019 was obtained from Health Research Ethics Committee, Faculty of Medicine Duta Wacana Christian University Yogyakarta. This research has been registered at Center for Health Resources and Services Research and Development Indonesia with the ethical approval number of 1087/C.16/FK/2019."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["DLBS1033","Standard
