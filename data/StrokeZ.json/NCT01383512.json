The aim of this multicenter controled randomized single blind study is to define the place of rehabilitation robotics at this phase of the rehabilitation process. Both groups will realize the same time of rehabilitation. The cost benefit ratio will be compared in each group through medical assessment of improvement and definition of the costs due to the rehabilitation process."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Subacute Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","rehabilitation","robotics","motor control","upper limb"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":238,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Rehabilitation robotics","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects will be practicing an Armeo Spring rehabilitation program in addition to their usual care (1.5h/day,5d/week) 1h/day 5d/week 4 weeks.","interventionNames":["Device: ARMEO Spring"]},{"label":"Self-rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Subject will associated to there classical care 1 hours, 5 days per week during 4 weeks, of self rehabilitation.","interventionNames":["Other: Self rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Healthy volunteer","type":"OTHER","description":"20 healthy volunteer will be recruiting and using ARMEO Spring.
