In our stroke unit, patients were treated with ALT, 0.9 mg/kg from March 2016 to February 2018 and then with TNK, 0.25 mg/kg from March 2018 to February 2020. MRI was controlled 1-2 hours within IVT (MRI-2). Early recanalization was assessed on an adapted Arterial Occlusion Lesion (AOL) scale, SR being defined as AOL 2/3 scores on MRI-2. The rate reduction of thrombus length (TL) when thrombus persisted, the IVT response threshold of TL and the infarct size evolution were also assessed. In the present study, the investigators sought to compare early rates of SR between the two lytics, based on a retrospective analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed early after IVT."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Distal Vessel Occlusion Stroke"],"keywords":["Acute","occlusion","recanalization","tenecteplase","alteplase","thrombolysis","ischemic","stroke-distal"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":172,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Alteplase (ALT)","description":"Patients with distal vessel occlusion stroke treated with alteplase (from March 2016 to February 2018)","interventionNames":["Drug: Alteplase (0.9mg/kg)"]},{"label":"Tenecteplase (TNK)","description":"Patients with distal vessel occlusion stroke treated with tenecteplase (from March 2018 to February 2020)","interventionNames":["Drug: Tenecteplase (0.25mg/kg)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Alteplase (0.9mg/kg)","description":"Intravenous thrombolysis with Alteplase (0.9 mg/kg, maximum 90 mg) with 10% of the dose given as a bolus followed by an infusion lasting 60 minutes.","armGroupLabels":["Alteplase (ALT)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tenecteplase (0.25mg/kg)","description":"Intravenous thrombolysis with Tenecteplase (0.25mg/kg, maximum 25 mg) with 100% of the dose given as a bolus.","armGroupLabels":["Tenecteplase (TNK)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Early successful recanalization rate","description":"Early successful recanalization rate defined by an Arterial Occlusive Lesion (AOL) scale grade 2 or 3 on MRI-2 performed between 1 and 2 hours after IVT.","timeFrame":"Between 1 and 2 hours after IVT"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Early complete recanalization rate","description":"Early complete successful recanalization rate defined by an Arterial Occlusive Lesion (AOL) scale grade 3 on MRI-2 performed between 1 and 2 hours after IVT.","timeFrame":"Between 1 and 2 hours after IVT"},{"measure":"Thrombus length change","description":"Thrombus length (TL) was approximated by measuring the susceptibility vessel sign (SVS) on the susceptibility weight angiography (SWAN) sequence.\n\nTL were measured in the 3 spatial planes, the higher value being retained.
