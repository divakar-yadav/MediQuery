The purpose of this research study is to examine whether dietary supplementation with an antioxidant extract can help promote healthy cognitive functioning as a component of recovery after stroke. The procedures include: Administering polyphenols via 2 POMx pills, each of which contains polyphenols derived from pomegranates equivalent to the content of approximately 8 ounces of pomegranate juice, or placebo pills (capsules containing no polyphenol ingredients), every day for one week to inpatients who are in the acute post-stroke phase. Neuropsychological testing pre- and post-treatment will determine whether cognitive functioning changes. Subjects will be randomized into either a placebo or polyphenol group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Pomegranate","Stroke","Neuropsychology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke - POMx","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Pomegranate supplement (1g) by mouth twice per day for 7 days","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: POMx"]},{"label":"Stroke - Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo (for POMx, containing no antioxidant contents; 1g) capsule by mouth twice per day for 7 days","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"POMx","description":"Pomegranate supplement (1g) by mouth twice per day for 7 days","armGroupLabels":["Stroke - POMx"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo","description":"Placebo (for POMx, containing no antioxidant contents; 1g) capsule by mouth twice per day for 7 days","armGroupLabels":["Stroke - Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change From Baseline Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) Score","description":"The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) provides both a total scale score and scores for 5 different cognitive domains.

Specifically, the test measures immediate memory (with list learning and story memory), visuospatial/constructional ability (with figure copy and line orientation), language (with picture naming and semantic fluency), attention (with digit span and coding), and delayed memory (with list recall, list recognition, story recall, and figure recall). Scores from all subtests are aggregated into a total composite score (manual provides conversion procedure). RBANS data were age-normed based on the sample described in the manual (Randolph, 2012) and were analyzed as index scores (also referred to as standard scores), which have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.

The scorer measures the degree of deviation from the center of each line (in cm) and attains the absolute value of the average percentage of deviation across all 20 lines. The scorer also attains the dominant direction of deviation (i.e., whether the examinee misses more to the left or to the right on average across the 20 lines).
