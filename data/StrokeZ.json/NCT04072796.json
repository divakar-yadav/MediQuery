The neurogenic bladder may possibly affect the quality of life of patients with stroke.\n\nObjectives: The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the quality of life and the neurogenic bladder in Turkish stroke survivors.\n\nMethods: 71 patients with stroke were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups: the First group consisted of patients with neurogenic bladder and the Second group consisted of patients without neurogenic bladder. Short Form-36 (SF-36), Barthel Index (BI), Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), Mini-Mental Test (MMT) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaires were applied to both groups for clinical evaluations."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Complication","Neurogenic Bladder"],"keywords":["urinary bladder, neurogenic","quality of life","socioeconomic factors","stroke rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Day","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":71,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Case group","description":"Case group reported urinary complaints","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Questionnaires"]},{"label":"Control group","description":"Control group did not have any urinary complaints.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Questionnaires"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Questionnaires","description":"Short Form-36 (SF-36), Barthel Index (BI), Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), Mini-Mental Test (MMT) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaires","armGroupLabels":["Case group","Control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Short Form-36 (SF-36)","description":"Short Form-36 (SF-36) was used to evaluate the quality of life of the patients. The form consists of 36 items, which measure 8 dimensions. These include (1) Physical function, (2) Social function, (3) Pain, (4) Energy/vitality, (5) Role limitation due to emotional problems , (6) Role limitation due to physical health problems, (7) Mental health and (8) General perception of health. Each subscale is evaluated between 0-100 points. A higher score indicates the better health.","timeFrame":"15 minutes"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Beck Depression Inventory","description":"Beck Depression Inventory was used to assess depressive signs. The scale consists of 21 items and the items are ordered from mild to severe. Evaluation is performed in a range of 0-63 points. The lower score indicates the better psychological profile.","timeFrame":"15 minutes"},{"measure":"Mini Mental Test (MMT)","description":"Mini Mental Test (MMT) was used to evaluate the extent of cognitive impairment. MMT is divided into 5 main categories: orientation (10 points), memory (3 points), attention and calculation (5 points), recalling (3 points) and language (9 points). Total points is 30. Total score between 0-9 points is considered as severe cognitive impairment. Total score between 10-19 points is considered as moderate cognitive impairment. Total score between 20-23 points is considered as mild cognitive impairment. Total score between 24-30 points is considered as normal.","timeFrame":"15 minutes"},{"measure":"Brunnstrom scale","description":"Brunnstrom scale is used to evaluate separately upper extremity, lower extremity or hand functions. Six stages are defined. Stage 1: No active movement, Stage 2: Mild spasticity, weak flexor-extensor synergy patterns, Stage 3: Marked spasticity, synergy patterns are evident, Stage 4: Some isolated movements other than synergy patterns can be seen, Stage 5: Decreased spasticity, most muscle activities are isolated, Stage 6: Phasic and well-coordinated isolated movements are performed. A higher point indicates the better status.","timeFrame":"15 minute"},{"measure":"Functional Ambulation Category","description":"Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) was used to evaluate the functional status. FAC assesses human support for ambulation rather than assistive devices. FAC 0: nonfunctional ambulation, FAC 1: Ambulator- dependent for physical assistance level II FAC 2: Ambulator- dependent for physical assistance level I, FAC 3: Ambulator-dependent for supervision FAC 4: Ambulator-independent level surfaces only FAC 5: Ambulator-independent.
