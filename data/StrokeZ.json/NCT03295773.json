Currently, the investigator applied 3-dimensional rotational angiogram (3DRA), a selective intra-arterial catheter-based imaging technique that had a superior spatial resolution compared with CT, MRI or DSA in depicting minute (\\<3mm) angio-architecture. Through 3DRA, the investigator could appreciate the ICAD patho-anatomy from a near-infinite number of planes, analyzing the stroke mechanisms and morphological changes with much improved precision. A neuro-radiologist and a stroke neurologist blind to time sequence will measure the geometric parameters and the luminal narrowing by WASID method."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Atheroscleroses, Cerebral"],"keywords":["Ischemic Stroke","3D-rotational angiography","Morphology","Atherosclerosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":140,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Symptomatic stroke patient","description":"Patients who are found signal void in a relevant intracranial internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery (stenosis \\>60%) will proceed to a 3-Dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA) at baseline and in 12 months.
