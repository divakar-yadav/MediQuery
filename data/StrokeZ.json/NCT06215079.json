The TMS group is planned to include 15 patients, the sham group 15 patients, and the group included in the conventional rehabilitation program only will also consist of 15 patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Complex Regional Pain Syndromes"],"keywords":["complex regional pain syndrome","transcranial magnetic stimulation","ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"active transcranial magnetic stimulation in stroke patients with complex regional pain syndrome","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) intensity for patients, applied under doctor supervision for a total of 5 days over one week (from Monday to Friday), will be set at 70% of the resting motor threshold.

While single-pulse TMS is generally used to explore the functioning of the brain, repetitive TMS is employed to induce lasting changes in brain activity. High-frequency rTMS leads to an increase in excitability in the motor cortex, whereas low-frequency application results in inhibition of motor cortical excitability. Theta-burst stimulation (TBS) is a form of rTMS that can be delivered continuously (cTBS) or intermittently (iTBS), thus modulating the excitability of corticospinal neurons beneath the stimulation area to either decrease or increase. rTMS is a growing research area in pain management, proven to be a safe and well-tolerated method.
