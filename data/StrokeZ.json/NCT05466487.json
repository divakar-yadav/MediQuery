Next to traditional stroke treatment, Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) offers the potential to facilitate stroke recovery as a complementary approach. Here, we aim at exploiting the principles of NIBS, specifically transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS), to promote functional recovery of people with neglect symptoms following stroke.\n\nObjective To determine whether neglect training complemented with tACS treatment in chronic stroke patients suffering from neglect improves neglect-related symptoms compared to neglect training with sham stimulation.\n\nStudy design Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled intervention study. After enrollment and completion of baseline measurements, participants are randomly assigned to either the active tACS group or sham (control) group.\n\nIntervention We will combine an evidence based visual scanning training (VST) with 40 minutes of (active or sham) tACS at alpha frequency. The intervention is administered three times a week for a duration of six weeks.\n\nOutcomes of the study Performance on standard, conventional neuropsychological tests, as well as on ADL observation scales."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spatial Neglect"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":22,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active tACS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS)","Behavioral: Visual Scanning Training (VST)"]},{"label":"Sham tACS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS)","Behavioral: Visual Scanning Training (VST)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS)","description":"Stimulation frequency and peak-to-peak intensity will be set to 10Hz and 1.5 milliampere (mA), phase offset will be set to 0 and 100 cycles will be used for ramping up.
