The cohort is a collaboration among multiple institutions (Jackson State University, Mississippi State Department of Health, Tougaloo College, and the University of Mississippi Medical Center), the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD), and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).","detailedDescription":"The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) initiated in 1998, is a longitudinal investigation of genetic and environmental risk factors associated with the disproportionate burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in African Americans. In addition, the JHS conducts community education and outreach activities to promote healthy lifestyles and reduce disease risk burden, undergraduate- and graduate-level research training programs, and high school science and math enrichment programs to prepare and encourage students from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups to pursue biomedical careers. The study recruited 5306 African-American residents living in the Jackson, MS, metropolitan statistical area of Hinds, Madison, and Rankin Counties. Participants were enrolled from each of 4 recruitment pools: random, 17%; volunteer, 30%; currently enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, 31% (shared JHS/ARIC cohort); and secondary family members, 22%. Recruitment was limited to non-institutionalized adult African Americans aged 35-84 years, except in a nested family cohort where those 21 to 34 years of age were also eligible. The final cohort included 6.59% of all African American residents in the Jackson MSA aged 35-84 during the baseline exam (N=76,426, US Census 2000). Among these, approximately 3,700 gave consent that allows genetic research and deposition of data into dbGaP. JHS participants have completed three clinical examinations (Exam 1, 2000-04; Exam 2, 2005-08; and Exam 3, 2009-13) that have generated extensive longitudinal data on traditional and putative CVD risk factors, socioeconomic and sociocultural factors, biochemical analytes, and measures of subclinical disease from echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) scans of the heart, aorta, and abdomen. Stored biological samples have been assayed for putative biochemical risk factors and stored for future research. DNA has been extracted and lymphocytes cryopreserved for study of candidate genes, genome-wide scanning, expression, and other -omics investigations. Participants have been contacted annually to update information, confirm vital status, document interim medical events, hospitalizations, and functional status, and obtain additional sociocultural information. Ongoing cohort surveillance includes abstraction of medical records and death certificates for relevant International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and adjudication of nonfatal events and deaths. The JHS serves as a resource to the scientific community for novel research, promotes cardiovascular health in the local community, and encourages underrepresented minority students to pursue biomedical careers.\n\nExam 4 began in 2020 and is ongoing. Data collection for the current exam includes anthropometrics, blood pressure, urine and blood samples, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, neurocognitive battery, physical function, interviews, and brain MRI."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiovascular Diseases","Heart Diseases","Atherosclerosis","Coronary Disease","Hypertension","Cerebrovascular Disorders"],"keywords":["Cardiovascular diseases","Heart failure","Stroke","Coronary heart disease","Diabetes","Hypertension","Chronic kidney disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Serum, plasma, urine, DNA"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cardiovascular Disease","description":"Coronary Heart Disease, Stroke, Heart Failure","timeFrame":"2000-2016"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mortality","description":"All Cause","timeFrame":"2000-2018"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* African American\n* Residents of Jackson, Mississippi\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Institutionalization","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"35 Years","maximumAge":"84 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"African-American men and women residents of metropolitan Jackson, Mississippi","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Wendy White, PhD","affiliation":"Tougaloo College JHS UTEC","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Marinelle Payton, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Jackson State University JHS GTEC","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"April P Carson, PhD","affiliation":"UMMC JHS CC and FC","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Victor Sutton, PhD","affiliation":"Mississippi State Department of Health JHS CEC","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Jennifer Reneker, PhD","affiliation":"UMMC JHS GTEC","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"UMMC, JSU, Tougaloo College, MSDH","city":"Jackson","state":"Mississippi","zip":"39213","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":32.29876,"lon":-90.18481}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"10100686","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Sempos CT, Bild DE, Manolio TA.
