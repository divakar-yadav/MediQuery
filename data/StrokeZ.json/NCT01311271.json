In that sense, rTMS has been used to treat a variety of symptoms of stroke during last two decades. Especially, improvement of upper extremity function has been proved by many studies. However, it remains uncertain about the optimum amount of rTMS.\n\nThe aim of this multicentric double blind study (randomized study) is to demonstrate the relationship between the amount of rTMS and the efficacy in the treatment of upper extremity motor deficits of stroke patients.\n\nFifty-seven patients will be included with written consent. After randomization, the subject will receive 3 different amount of treatment rTMS-rTMS, Sham-rTMS, Sham-Sham) in double blind methods."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiplegia"],"keywords":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular disease","hemiplegia","Transcranial magnetic stimulation","repetitive transcranial magnetic
