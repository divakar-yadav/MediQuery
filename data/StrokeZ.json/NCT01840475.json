The patients will be divided in sub-groups according to the time interval between occurrence of stroke and start of treatment (early, medium and late start of treatment according to the first and third quartiles time distribution). It is hypothesized that the \"early\" start of treatment group will have a reduced modified Ashworth scale (MAS) on the elbow and wrist flexors when compared to the \"late\" start of treatment
