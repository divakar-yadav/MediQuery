Osteopathic manual therapy (OMT) is a hands-on treatment that is performed by a specially trained physician known as a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO). This treatment can be used to diagnose and treat somatic dysfunctions, which are palpable areas of tightness, misalignment, and/or restricted motion within the musculoskeletal system and its related vascular and neural structures. A combination of myofascial release, strain/counterstain, soft tissue, balanced ligamentous release, facilitated positional release and muscle energy techniques will be used for the OMT treatment.","armGroupLabels":["Osteopathic Manual Treatment"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Sham Treatment","description":"The sham treatment will include a hands-on evaluation typically used to diagnose somatic dysfunctions, but no treatment will be performed.
