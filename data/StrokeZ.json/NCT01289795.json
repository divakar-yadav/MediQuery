However, endothelial dysfunction (ED) is not established as a risk factor for ischemic stroke.\n\nAs a novelty the proposed trial investigates the following variety of indirect markers of endothelial function in acute ischemic stroke:\n\ncirculating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), endothelial microparticles (EMP), ENDOPAT (RH- PAT ratio) in two regards:\n\n1. time after ischemic events (\\< 48h, Days 4-5, day 7 or at discharge)\n2. etiological stroke subtypes\n\nIt is not known whether these parameters are changed after acute cerebral ischemia and could possibly serve as specific target for treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Cerebral Infarction","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Brain Diseases","Central Nervous System Diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"whole blood, serum, PBMC, plasma"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"first-ever ischemic stroke","description":"first-ever ischemic stroke according to the WHO definition"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Levels of cEPC","description":"Levels of cEPC (CD34+/CD133+/VEGF2R+/CD31) in % of mononuclear cells using flow cytometry with respect to stroke subtypes.","timeFrame":"<48h, day 4-5, discharge or day 7"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Levels of EMP","description":"Levels of EMP (Annexin V+/CD31+;
