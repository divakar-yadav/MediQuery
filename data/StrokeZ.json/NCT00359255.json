We propose to design an exercise program for the affected arm and hand that would be given to the client as homework and done in the client's hospital room. The program would be designed and monitored by a therapist that works in the hospital.\n\nWe believe that this program will: 1) increase arm and hand recovery over usual care received in the hospital, 2) help people make the move from therapist run exercise to self management of exercise, and 3) promote family involvement in therapy.","detailedDescription":"In total 250 participants admitted for stroke rehabilitation at 4 BC sites will be randomly assigned to either the experimental or the control group. The extra arm and hand exercise program (experimental group) will receive usual therapy plus 60 minutes per day of additional arm exercises. This program will last for 4 weeks while the participant is in the hospital. The arm and hand program will include muscle strengthening and stretching, repetitive reaching, folding, stacking, pushing and pulling tasks, picking up objects, and activities that use speed and accuracy. The family will be encouraged to participate in the program with the participant. The control group will receive usual therapy only."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Exercise","rehabilitation","upper limb","inpatient","RCT","activities of daily living"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Education manual"]},{"label":"2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: An inpatient homework based exercise program for the upper limb post stroke"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Education manual","description":"The control arm was given education on stroke, the affected arm post strooke, bone health, and healthy living.
