Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is effective at treating frontal lobe dysfunction in the form of anxiety and depression occurring during the chronic phase of stroke recovery. The aim of this study is to use MBSR to improve other forms of frontal lobe dysfunction (cognitive outcomes) during the subacute phase of recovery, when patients are making critical decisions regarding patients' ability to return to work or live independently; and to use MEG, a tool capable of imaging brain activity and neuronal networks, to understand the brain changes that correspond to improvement after treatment.","detailedDescription":"Thrombectomy has significantly improved stroke outcomes. Nearly 80% of the investigators' clinic population now present with small strokes and low NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores. However, despite \"good recoveries\", greater than 40% endorse significant problems with concentration, attention, executive function, processing speed, and mood during the subacute phase of recovery. This dysfunction prohibits individuals from fully reintegrating into the individuals' prior home and workplace environments and can result in early retirement or loss of independence, particularly in the older population. Some degree of recovery is observed by 6 months, but it is often incomplete or too late to reverse prior life-altering decisions. The impaired executive function and processing speed appear to occur independent of stroke size, location, or co-existing depression.\n\nMagnetoencephalography (MEG) is a functional imaging tool able to evaluate neurophysiologic processes in real time similar to EEG, but with better spatial resolution. The investigators' prior work with MEG suggests that cerebral activation patterns are not only slowed and more dispersed during task completion in individuals with minor stroke compared to controls, but that there is abnormal activity in the frontal lobes, even at rest. Unfortunately, many patients do not qualify for rehabilitation and there is little data regarding effective treatment options to hasten or augment recovery.\n\nMindfulness training may provide an attractive therapeutic option. A combination of meditation, body awareness, and yoga, Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is an active process thought to engage the frontal lobes. MBSR has been shown to improve anxiety and depression in patients with chronic disease states like migraine and diabetes, and has also been evaluated in a small series of patients with chronic stroke and traumatic brain injury demonstrating improved performance during tasks of executive function.\n\nThe investigators propose to study the effect of MBSR in the early phase of stroke recovery to determine if this intervention can help to prevent post-stroke morbidity. A cohort of patients \\[NIHSS \\<8, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2\\] will be enrolled. Half will be randomized to a standard 8 week course of MBSR, while the control group will instead participate in a weekly Stroke Support Group (SSG). Depression, cognition, patient perception of recovery, and degree of re-integration into prior environments will be evaluated pre- and post-intervention to determine the impact of mindfulness training on subacute post-stroke depression and cognition. All participants will undergo neuroimaging using MEG pre- and post-intervention to determine the neurophysiologic effect of treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke Sequelae","Depression","Cognitive Impairment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Patients will be randomized to an 8 week Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course versus a traditional Stroke Support Group (SSG)","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants randomized to the MBSR arm will undergo a standard 8 week course.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)"]},{"label":"Stroke Support Group (SSG)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"As a control group, participants will participate in 8 weeks of weekly Stroke Support Group.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Stroke Support Group (SSG)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)","description":"Participants randomized to the MBSR arm will undergo a standard 8 week course of MBSR taught by a psychologist trained in the MBSR protocol and encouraged to engage in additional individual mindfulness sessions using a cell phone application.","armGroupLabels":["Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Stroke Support Group (SSG)","description":"As a control group, participants randomized to the SSG arm will participate in 8 weeks of weekly Stroke Support Group sessions to experience activity and socialization without additional mindfulness training.","armGroupLabels":["Stroke Support Group (SSG)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Cognition as assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score","description":"The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) tests executive function, attention, concentration, memory, and processing speed.
