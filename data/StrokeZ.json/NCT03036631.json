As a pilot registry, it is anticipated to enroll 40 acute stroke patients requiring mechanical thrombectomy over 12-18 months. Following enrollment, data will be collected prospectively from medical records and from patients' visits."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conscious Sedation/Monitored Anesthesia Care"},{"label":"General Anesthesia"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time interval between groin puncture and final recanalization","timeFrame":"6 months or at study completion"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age ≥ 18 years\n* Suitable for intra-arterial treatment for acute stroke up to 8 hours from onset of symptoms\n* Clinical equipoise for best mode of sedation\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any known allergy to either proposed medication and its alternative\n* Any patient that has been intubated prior to randomization\n* Posterior circulation strokes\n* Age ≤ 18\n* Pregnant female","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients underwent mechanical thrombectomy at Los Robles hospital, Thousand Oaks, CA","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Muhammad A Taqi","affiliation":"Neurovascular Research Foundation","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Los Robles Hospital and Medical Center","city":"Thousand Oaks","state":"California","zip":"91360","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":34.17056,"lon":-118.83759}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"30717046","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Taqi MA, Suriya SS, Sodhi A, Quadri SA, Farooqui M, Zafar A, Mortazavi MM.
