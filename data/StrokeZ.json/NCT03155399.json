These properties are still maintained in the adult age and potentially activated in case of brain lesion. In the present study authors hypothesized that a significant recovery of voluntary muscle contraction in post stroke patients experiencing severe upper limb paresis can be obtained, when proprioceptive based stimulations are provided. The proprioceptive based training (PBT) aims to stimulate the emergence of voluntary contraction and to foster motor recovery. It is based on motor learning principles, such as the repetition of tasks with concurrent use of feedbacks. The proposed concept is based on the concurrent repetitions of movements performed with the non-affected limb and with the affected one, passively mobilized by physiotherapist in charge of guaranteeing the optimal kinematic execution."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Stroke","Neurorehabilitation","Proprioceptive Training","Bilateral Arm Training","Intracortical Inhibition"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The assessment was conducted by two physiotherapists not involved in providing the experimental treatment.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Proprioceptive based training (PBT)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The treatment will last one hour and will be divided as follows: 2 proprioceptive based stimulation sessions per 3 minutes for each movement, with a rest of 2 minutes between each session.

The movement execution of the affected arm will be supported by the physiotherapist performing passive movement at the same rhythm, as the one executed with the unaffected side. Patient will be asked to focus the attention on the movement performed against gravity, which will be reinforced by a verbal command. Afterwards, the physiotherapist will fully support movement execution coherently with the patient's movement initialization.
