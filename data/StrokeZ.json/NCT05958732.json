Cerebrovascular accident (CVA), is the second most leading cause of mortality (5.5 million cases yearly). Its occurrence remains high, with 13.7 million annual incident cases globally. Ischemic strokes are more common with a prevalence ratio of 76-119 per 100,000 per year worldwide ). Stroke is a neurological disease that decrease sensorimotor functions by causing irreversible impairments to the nervous system due to cerebral vascular problems . Patients with balance and activity disturbance are indicated by reduce in body functions. It is very essential for CVA patients to improve balance stability and muscle power for recovery and for normal activities ). Balance is an essential factor for independent living. It is maintained by adjusting COG (Center of Gravity) over the BOS (Base of Support). These adjustments are done through sensational inputs from the vestibular, visual and somatosensory system and are maintained by brain.","detailedDescription":"Impairment of balance stability is common in stroke patients. Patients with cerebrovascular accident (CVA) present mainly with asymmetric standing balance that affects their stability limits, and leads to major difficulty in functional independence. A reduction in maintaining balance is one of the major element that adversely affect after stroke. Coordination is another important factor, which allows a person to perform purposeful movement. After cerebrovascular accidents mainly impairment in coordination may be an element in mobility and movement limitations. Restoring the coordinated movement after cerebrovascular accident in important in regaining normal living activities. Those patients who survive from stroke may experience instant changes in thinking, language, balance, coordination, proprioception, body functions and quality of life. Stroke rehabilitation is the restoring functions of the impaired body regions and it is a long and time taking process, both for patients and for rehabilitation teams. Body awareness therapy (BAT) is a physiotherapeutic restorative approach that examine the patient's condition and focus towards relearning self-awareness movements. Body awareness therapy helps in strengthening the patient and also performing in activities of daily living (ADLs). A basic movement is stimulation of center line by weight shifting from right towards left and rotatory movements around the center of body and vice versa. Movements can be achieved in supine, sitting and standing position. Unfortunately, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) study has so far evaluated the effect of body awareness therapy (BAT) on balance and coordination in stroke survivals. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess BAT on balance and coordination in patients with cerebrovascular accident (CVA)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Balance,","Coordination","mini-mental scale","BBS","Cognition"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Experimental group will be receiving conventional therapy and body awareness therapy for 30 minutes, 5 days a week for two weeks.

Berg Balance Scale involves 14 different tasks that can be categorized into different domains. Each task is divided into five grades for assessing the level of stability and un-stability and grades are from zero to four. Zero is graded when the person is unable and not performing the task fully and four is given when the person is fully able and able to perform the task independently. However, the score of the Berg balance scale ranges from 0 to 56. The score can be calculated or measured after assessment. From zero to twenty (0-20) severe impairment. From score Twenty-one to forty (21-40) moderate impairment. From score forty-one to fifty-six (41-56) minimal impairment.","timeFrame":"2 weeks"},{"measure":"Co-ordination","description":"The tests that can be performed to measure the coordination of the upper region and the lower region can be equilibrium and non-equilibrium tests.\n\nThe non-Equilibrium test is a simple and very effective clinical assessment screening test and would be assessed as the Finger nose test, Finger Finger Test, and Rebound Phenomena. For the lower limb heel-to-shin test, draw a circle test.\n\nEquilibrium tests can be performed in a sitting position, in a standing position, and in a walking position. Coordination tests whether equilibrium or non-equilibrium can be assessed into five grades from 0 grade to 4 grade. Grade 0 (Activity Impossible) Grade 1 (severe Impairment) Grade 2 (moderate Impairment) Grade 3 (Minimal Impairment) Grade 4 ( normal Performance).","timeFrame":"2 weeks"},{"measure":"Cognition","description":"The Mini-Mental State examination is used to check cognition, and orientation, registration, attention and calculation, and memory recall of the objects.
