The auditory processes investigated are attention, short-term memory, sound-induced emotions. To characterize auditory deficits after brain damage or in migraine, neuropsychological assessments are combined with neurophysiological markers (Electro-encephalography: EEG, Magneto-encephalography: MEG, Magnetic Resonance Imaging: MRI)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Migraine Disorders, Brain"],"keywords":["Audition","Stroke","Migraine","Attention","Short-term memory,","Emotions","EEG","MEG"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":262,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Brain-damaged patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Neuropsychological tests","Other: Neurophysiological tests"]},{"label":"Control participants","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Neuropsychological tests","Other: Neurophysiological tests"]},{"label":"Migraine patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Neuropsychological tests","Other: Neurophysiological tests"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Neuropsychological tests","description":"Neuropsychological tests consist in listening to sounds in various contexts and providing behavioral responses with response-buttons.","armGroupLabels":["Brain-damaged patients","Control participants","Migraine patients"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Neurophysiological tests","description":"Neurophysiological tests consist in the recording of EEG and/or MEG signals while realizing the neuropsychological tests, as well as MRI scanning to characterize the patients' brain lesions and reconstruct the brain sources of surface EEG/MEG signals.","armGroupLabels":["Brain-damaged patients","Control participants","Migraine patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentages of correct responses in Neuropsychological tests","timeFrame":"up to 2 months"},{"measure":"reaction times in Neuropsychological tests","timeFrame":"up to 2 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Event-Related Potentials (EEG) in Neurophysiological tests","timeFrame":"up to 2 months"},{"measure":"Event-Related Fields (MEG) in Neurophysiological tests","timeFrame":"up to 2 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age from 18 to 80\n* MEG/MRI compatibility\n* Motivation to participate efficiently in the study\n* No severe hearing loss\n* Informed consent to participate in the study\n* Affiliation to social security\n* For brain-damaged patients : no need for medical assistance; focal temporal and/or frontal lesion; no major cognitive impairment; ability to understand and apply the instructions for neuropsychological testing; testing at least one-month after the event resulting in brain damage; absence of neurological and psychiatric disorders besides the lesion\n* For migraine patients: no need for medical assistance; migraine diagnosis; no major cognitive impairment; ability to understand and apply the instructions for neuropsychological testing; absence of neurological and psychiatric disorders besides the migraine\n* Healthy participants: absence of neurological and psychiatric disorders\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age below 18 or above 80\n* MRI scanning not possible: artificial cardiac pacemaker, insulin pump, metallic prosthesis, intra-cerebral clip, claustrophobia\n* MEG acquisition not possible: large heads, neurostimulator, metal in the head or the body.\n* Pregnant or breast-feeding women","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Norbert NIGHOGHOSSIAN, MD","affiliation":"Unité 201, Hôpital Neurologique, Hospices Civils de Lyon","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Unité 201, Hôpital Neurologique","city":"Bron","zip":"69500","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":45.73333,"lon":4.91667}},{"facility":"Service Explorations Fonctionnelles Neurologiques, Hôpital de la Croix-Rousse","city":"Lyon","zip":"69004","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":45.74848,"lon":4.84669}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"33606142","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Masson R, Demarquay G, Meunier D, Leveque Y, Hannoun S, Bidet-Caulet A, Caclin A.
