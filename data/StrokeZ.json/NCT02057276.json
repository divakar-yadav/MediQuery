This is a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled rTMS study in conjunction with intensive daily occupational therapy (OT) for 2 weeks to improve motor function in hemiparetic patients. Participants will be followed for at least 12 weeks after rTMS to detect any clinical change. The sham group participants will be offered an open-label active rTMS treatment plus OT after the 12 week assessment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Pediatric Stroke","Cerebral Palsy","Chronic Hemiparesis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active rTMS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive daily active rTMS with occupational therapy immediately following rTMS for 10 consecutive weekdays.","interventionNames":["Device: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Other: Occupational Therapy"]},{"label":"Sham rTMS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive daily sham rTMS with occupational therapy immediately following rTMS for 10 consecutive weekdays.","interventionNames":["Device: Sham Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Other: Occupational Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","description":"We will use a specific rTMS paradigm called Continuous Theta Burst Stimulation (cTBS) for this study.","armGroupLabels":["Active rTMS"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","armGroupLabels":["Sham rTMS"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Occupational Therapy","armGroupLabels":["Active rTMS","Sham rTMS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in the \"Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function\"","timeFrame":"Change in the \"Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function\" between baseline and 3 days after rTMS/OT"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in the \"Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function\"","timeFrame":"Change in the \"Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function\" between baseline and 7 days after rTMS/OT"},{"measure":"Change in the \"Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function\"","timeFrame":"Change in the \"Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function\" between baseline and 12 weeks after rTMS/OT"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age â‰¥ 10 years; \\< 21 years\n* Hemiparesis\n* Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) level I through IV\n* Provision of written informed consent by the patient and/or guardian, including understanding that insurance may be billed for the occupational therapy\n* Written assent form signed by participants younger than 18 years of age\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Underlying degenerative or metabolic disorder or supervening medical illness\n* Severe depression or other psychiatric disorder\n* Any participant who is pregnant\n* Any contraindication to TMS (i.e., intracranial metal implants, shunts, ports, pacemaker, baclofen pumps)\n* Any changes or addition of neuropsychiatric medications within 1 month of starting the study or during course of the study (if applicable)\n* Any botulinum toxin (Botox, Myobloc) or phenol injection within the last 3 months prior to the study or during the course of the study (if applicable)\n* Any upper extremity surgery within the last 6 months prior to the study or scheduled during the course of the study (if applicable)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"10 Years","maximumAge":"20 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Steve W Wu, MD","affiliation":"Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center","city":"Cincinnati","state":"Ohio","zip":"45229","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":39.12713,"lon":-84.51435}}]}},"resultsSection":{"participantFlowModule":{"preAssignmentDetails":"After signing consent forms, two separate participants did not proceed with the study.
