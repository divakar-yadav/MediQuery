The primary endpoint will be the measure of early changes in cerebral glucose uptake reflecting microperfusion.","detailedDescription":"We hypothesize that an early irreversible microvascular deterioration following initial bleeding could contribute to DCI occurrence. More precisely, we suspect that DCI areas are somehow overlaps of regions in which microperfusion is precociously altered, shortening circulatory reserves, and territories of secondarily spasmed arteries further lowering blood flow, resulting in ischemia. We aim to explore the potential microvasculature alteration through cerebral glucose perfusion and metabolism assessment using early dynamic 18F-fluorodesoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computer Tomography (dynamic 18F-FDG PET/CT). If our hypothesis turned out to be valid, we would at the same time be able to determine risk factors for this unpredictable complication and gain remarkable insight into DCI pathophysiology. Thus, the purpose of this trial is to demonstrate, in patients affected by SAH, the correlation between early cerebral glucose uptake defects in 18F-FDG PET/CT and delayed cerebral infarction in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Haemorrhage"],"keywords":["Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage","Delayed Cerebral Ischemia","Positron emission tomography","Cerebral microcirculation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":35,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All participants will receive study intervention","interventionNames":["Other: Early dynamic 18F-FDG PET/CT assessment of cerebral glucose uptake"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Early dynamic 18F-FDG PET/CT assessment of cerebral glucose uptake","description":"The intervention will consist in a dynamic cerebral 18F-FDG PET study performed at D2+/-1.
