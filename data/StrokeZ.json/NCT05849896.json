The main objectives are: 1) to technically and clinically validate the WPM-SEMG-V2 device in healthy volunteers; 2) to demonstrate the clinical relevance of the HD sEMG signals to support the process of rehabilitation of post-stroke patients. Participants will be asked to perform simple exercises using the muscles of the hand or the leg in static or dynamic contractions while wearing the WPM-SEMG-V2 device.","detailedDescription":"The participant will be instructed how to execute static or the dynamic exercises while wearing the WPM-SEMG-V2 device. The WPM-SEMG-V2 device will be initially tested in a small number of healthy volunteers to evaluate the technical and clinical performance of the device in different settings (i.e., static and dynamic muscle contractions). Preliminary information gathered in the first part of the investigation may eventually guide further device modifications. The second part will capture preliminary clinical performance of the device in post-stroke patients. The main aim is to study the behaviour of the neuromuscular system in voluntary muscle activations and demonstrate the clinical relevance of the HD sEMG signals to support the process of rehabilitation of post-stroke subjects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Static contractions in healthy volunteers","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Acquisition of HD SEMG signals of an upper limb muscle and a lower limb muscle while the participant executes simple static exercises.","interventionNames":["Device: Acquisition of HD sEMG signals using the WPM-SEMG device"]},{"label":"Dynamic contractions in healthy volunteers","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Acquisition of HD SEMG signals of a leg muscle while the participant executes simple dynamic exercises.This arm will recruited recreationally active or athletic volunteers, preferably between 18 and 20 years","interventionNames":["Device: Acquisition of HD sEMG signals using the WPM-SEMG device"]},{"label":"Static contractions in post-stroke patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Acquisition of HD SEMG signals of a lower limb muscle while the participant executes simple static exercises.","interventionNames":["Device: Acquisition of HD sEMG signals using the WPM-SEMG device"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Acquisition of HD sEMG signals using the WPM-SEMG device","description":"The WPM-SEMG-V2 device will be placed over the muscle of the participant to be investigated.
