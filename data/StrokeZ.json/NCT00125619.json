We enrolled 16 persons with chronic (\\>6 months) hemiparesis post-stroke who were randomized to traditional/manual or robotic locomotor training. All individuals received 12 sessions (thrice weekly for four weeks) of training. Each session involved 30 minutes of stepping.\n\nThe complete study results are published."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["biomechanics","stroke","electromyography","Gait disability stroke","locomotor therapy","muscular weakness","reflex variability stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1: Therapist assisted","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Therapist assisted locomotor training (partial body-weight supported)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Locomotor training"]},{"label":"Arm 2: Robot-assisted","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Robot-assisted locomotor training (partial body-weight supported)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Locomotor training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Locomotor training","description":"This study compares two forms of Iocomotor training: 1) standard or manual - in which an individual is provided partial body weight support while walking on a treadmill with assistance of 1-3 therapists to move the legs and stabilize the trunk/pelvis and 2) robotic-guided - in which an exoskeleton robot (Lokomat) guides movement of the walking pattern.
