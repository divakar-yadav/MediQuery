However, there are few studies on the correlation between ischemic stroke with cancer and human microbiome and metabolites Whether the human microbiome and its metabolites are associated with the prognosis of such patients remains to be investigated. Therefore, this study hypothesized that structural changes in the human microbiome and its metabolites in patients with acute ischemic stroke with active cancer were associated with stroke severity and disease recovery Therefore, this topic proposed by collecting active follow-up cancer of acute ischemic stroke patients after admission and oral swabs Excrement and urine and blood samples, and based on the queue, follow-up analysis of the human microbiome dynamic change rule and the prognosis of patients with cancer of the acute ischemic stroke correlation, activity, further explore the secondary prevention of stroke management strategy based on the human microbiome."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke, Acute","Tumor
