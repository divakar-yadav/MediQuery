However, the benefit of oxygen therapy is controversial. Severity of stroke may affect the benefit of oxygen supplementation. Abnormal breathing patterns are commonly found among stroke patients and may increase the risk of hypoxemia. High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has several advantages from controllable fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), reduction of nasopharyngeal resistance and positive end expiratory pressure effect. In this study, we aimed to assess the therapeutic effect of HFNC on oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and neurological outcomes in stroke patients with moderate and severe severities, compared with no and low flow oxygen supplementation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["High flow oxygen therapy","Oxygen desaturation index","Acute ischemic stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"No oxygen","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"No oxygen supplementation given"},{"label":"Low flow oxygen","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Oxygen cannula with a flow rate of 2 liter/minute","interventionNames":["Device: Low flow oxygen"]},{"label":"High flow oxygen","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Heated humidified high flow oxygen cannula (Optiflow; temperature of 34°C and fractional inspired oxygen of 0.24) with a flow rate of 20 liter/minute","interventionNames":["Device: High flow oxygen"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"High flow oxygen","description":"Heated humidified high flow oxygen cannula (Optiflow; temperature of 34°C and fractional inspired oxygen of 0.24) with a flow rate of 20 liter/minute","armGroupLabels":["High flow oxygen"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Low flow oxygen","description":"Oxygen cannula with a flow rate of 2 liter/minute","armGroupLabels":["Low flow oxygen"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Oxygen desaturation index","description":"The number of times per hour that the oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry drop from baseline more than 4% for at least 10 seconds","timeFrame":"In the first 24 hours of study period"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mean oxygen saturation","timeFrame":"In the first 24 hours of study period"},{"measure":"Lowest oxygen saturation","timeFrame":"In the first 24 hours of study period"},{"measure":"The number of subjects with oxygen desaturation","timeFrame":"In the first 24 hours of study period"},{"measure":"Percentages of cumulative time of oxygen desaturation","timeFrame":"In the first 24 hours of study period"},{"measure":"NIHSS changes","description":"The NIHSS at randomization minus the NIHSS at the 7th day of admission","timeFrame":"at the 7th day of admission or at discharge date"},{"measure":"The number of subjects with NIHSS improvement by 4 or more","timeFrame":"at the 7th day of admission or at discharge date"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
