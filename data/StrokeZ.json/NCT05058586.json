Subjects who participated in the study were randomly assigned to anti-gravity treadmill training, underwater walking therapy, and control group. Investigators examined the aerobic capacity of participants by using the 6-minute walk test and cycle ergometer testing before starting the treatment along with a one-month follow-up. The patient's balance was examined by using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Cardiovascular"],"keywords":["underwater walking theraphy","anti-gravity treadmill training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conventional theraphy group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"13 patients received twenty sessions of conventional therapy for four weeks","interventionNames":["Other: The Effects of Aerobic Exercise Training on Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Functional Capacity, Balance and Ventricular Repolarization Indices in Stroke Patients"]},{"label":"Anti gravity treadmill training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"13 patients received twenty sessions of conventional therapy for four weeks and Alter-G training was performed 3 days/week for 4 weeks, with up to 30 min. of training per session.","interventionNames":["Other: The Effects of Aerobic Exercise Training on Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Functional Capacity, Balance and Ventricular Repolarization Indices in Stroke Patients"]},{"label":"Underwater walking therapy group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"13 patients received twenty sessions of conventional therapy for four weeks and three sessions of aerobic exercise treatment of 45 minutes per week underwater","interventionNames":["Other: The Effects of Aerobic Exercise Training on Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Functional Capacity, Balance and Ventricular Repolarization Indices in Stroke Patients"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"The Effects of Aerobic Exercise Training on Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Functional Capacity, Balance and Ventricular Repolarization Indices in Stroke Patients","description":"Seventy patients with history of stroke admitted to our center between July 2017 and January 2018.
