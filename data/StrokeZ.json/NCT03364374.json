However, there has been a failure to implement interprofessional guidelines into today's stroke rehabilitation clinical practice. Instead it is common that one discipline focuses on recovery of posture, while another discipline focuses on recovery of fine motor skills. The investigators argue that control of the hand is not independent from postural control. In fact, treating them separately ignores the kinematic and muscular linkages connecting the trunk to the hand via the scapula and proximal arm. It also ignores evidence that postural and hand muscles have overlapping cortical representations thus likely have similar neural control networks. Hence, the overall goal of this project is to demonstrate the relationship of posture and fine motor skills to advance stroke rehabilitation.\n\nThe study will include two groups, stroke survivors and neurologically healthy controls, and both will perform a tracing task while seated on a backless bench. The task will be performed twice, at baseline and after giving participants cues to improve their posture. Both task repetitions will be performed in a single session on the same day. Kinetic and kinematic data will be collected to evaluate posture, postural stability and fine motor performance. Data collected at baseline will be used to examine the relationship between postural impairments and fine motor deficits. Additionally, we will evaluate the effects of postural cues on body segment alignment, stability and fine motor performance."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke rehabilitation","Upper extremity","Posture"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":38,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke survivors","description":"Individuals that experienced uni-hemispheric ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Postural counseling"]},{"label":"Controls","description":"Healthy controls with no history of stroke","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Postural counseling"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Postural counseling","description":"A therapist will provide verbal/physical cues to improve the participants posture","armGroupLabels":["Controls","Stroke survivors"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in tracing smoothness from baseline to after postural counseling","description":"Change in the average jerk of the hand trajectory during a tracing task","timeFrame":"Within 24 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in center of pressure displacement from baseline to after postural counseling","description":"Change in the maximum center of pressure displacement during a tracing task","timeFrame":"Within 24 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Stroke survivors:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* experienced uni-hemispheric ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke 3 mo - 7 yrs prior\n* ability to grasp and hold a stylus for the duration of the experiments\n* passive motion throughout the paretic UE within 20Â° of normal\n* dominant side affected\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* lesion in brainstem or cerebellum\n* presence of other neuro-disease impairing motor skills\n* unable to understand 3-step directions\n* pain, orthopedic condition or impaired corrected vision that would alter reaching\n\nHealthy Controls:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* no history of stroke or incomplete spinal cord injury\n* no medical, orthopedic, neurological, or uncorrected visual condition that would limit the ability to participate in upper extremity testing\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* none","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Stroke patients will be recruited from the MUSC Center for Rehabilitation Research in Neurological Conditions database (approved IRB PRO# 15991, PI Kautz) that currently contains contact information for \\~120 stroke survivors who have agreed to be contacted for research participation.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Christian Finetto, PhD","affiliation":"Medical University of South Carolina","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Medical University of South Carolina","city":"Charleston","state":"South Carolina","zip":"29425","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":32.77657,"lon":-79.93092}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
