Numerous factors predisposing to peripheral embolism in patients with AF have been well defined, documented and included in the CHA2DS2VASC score. Although proper anticoagulation minimizes the risk attributable to \"known\" risk factors, stroke may still occur. Thus, \"unknown\" risk factors may play an important role in stroke risk stratification in patients with AF. The investigators assume that one of the important \"unknown\" risk factor is left atrial appendage (LAA) morphology. The ASSAM study is planned to include 100 patients after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and known status of anticoagulation at the time of stroke. The control group will consist of 100 patients scheduled for AF ablation without a history of stroke or TIA."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients without stroke","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will consists of patients scheduled for atrial fibrillation ablation without history of stroke.","interventionNames":["Radiation: computed tomography"]},{"label":"Patients with history of stroke","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will consists of patients after ischemic stroke and history of atrial fibrillation.","interventionNames":["Radiation: computed tomography"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"RADIATION","name":"computed tomography","description":"CT angiography will be performed with a dual-source CT scanner using prospective ECG gating, with detector collimation of 128x0.6 mm, a gantry rotation time of 280 ms, tube voltage of 100-120 kV, tube current of 280-380 mAs depending on the patient's body mass.","armGroupLabels":["Patients with history of stroke","Patients without stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The LAA morphology in patients with an elevated risk of peripheral thromboembolism defined as CHA2DS2-VAScore >2","description":"The investigators will examine association of specific type of LAA morphology with ischemic stroke taking in to account anticoagulation in the time of stroke/TIA.\n\nThe morphology of LAA will be divided into 4 types:\n\n* the chicken wing -
