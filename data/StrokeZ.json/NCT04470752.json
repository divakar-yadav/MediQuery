Oral treatment will be applied 3 times daily either during meals or during regular swallowing tests/trainings accompanied by a Speech Language Pathologist. After re-assessment of the dysphagia after 7 days, patients with persistent dysphagia and applicable for further treatment will be treated for another 23 days with a final clinical swallowing evaluation after a total of 30 days.
