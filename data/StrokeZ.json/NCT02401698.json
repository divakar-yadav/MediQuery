Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be used to monitor this plasticity by mapping the brain's function (measuring brain activity). Recent research suggests that TMS can be used for both prognosis (determining future function) and to determine what type of rehabilitation therapy will work best after stroke. The purposes of this research study are to: 1) determine changes in cerebellar activity after motor cortical stroke 2) compare changes in recovery of motor function with changes in cerebellar - motor cortex connections; 3) determine the ability of TMS to \"predict\" functional outcome after stroke. The primary hypotheses are: 1) functional recovery will be correlated with TMS changes (as measure of motor threshold (MT), intracortical inhibition, cerebellar cerebral inhibition (CBI), motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and recruitment curves; 2) baseline TMS will predict future functional outcomes.","detailedDescription":"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be used to monitor this plasticity by mapping the brain's function (measuring brain activity).
