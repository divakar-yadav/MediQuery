From November 2007 to December 2009, 12000 subjects are included in 200 clinical research centers all over China. The subjects naturally formed two cohorts based on taking Dengzhan Shengmai capsule or not. The basic therapy included antiplatelet aggregation , stroke health education, management of blood pressure, blood lipid and blood glucose, etc. Then all of the subjects are visited on the 360th day after inclusion. The recurrence of stroke, cardiovascular events, and peripheral arterial events are observed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"drug","interventionNames":["Drug: :Deng Zhan Sheng Mai Capsule"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":":Deng Zhan Sheng Mai Capsule","description":"capsule，0.18g，2＃，po，Bid\\*1year.","armGroupLabels":["1"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"recurrence of stroke","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cardiovascular events and other peripheral vascular events Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 40-75 years old\n* Ischemic stroke diagnosed by CT/MRI scan\n* Patient presenting from 14 days to 6 months of first onset of Ischemic stroke.\n* Presence of at least one risk factor of stroke (such as hypertension, Diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, hyperlipidemia, and smoking, etc.)that can be interfered in.\n* Informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Silent cerebral infarction;\n* Patients after vasculoplasty with Intracranial Artery Stenosis.\n* Watian drinking test≥grade 4.\n* MRS=grade 5.\n* Cerebral infarction due to other causes except arterial Sclerosis(i.e. cardiogenic embolism, arteritis, polycythemia vera, primary thrombocythemia, sickle-cell anemia,, thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura, DIC, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, Moyamoya disease, intracranial vascular malformations etc);\n* Presence of serious heart disease, heart, liver, lung, and kidney functional failure;
