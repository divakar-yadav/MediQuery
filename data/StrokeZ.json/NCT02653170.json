The MISTT study will test the effect of two complementary interventions against usual care. The two interventions include: a) Stroke Case Managers (SCMs) who are trained social workers, and b) an online informational website or portal. The 12 week intervention period begins when the stroke patient returns home from the hospital or rehab facility. The SCMs will conduct at least 2 home visits with the patient (one within 3-4 days and one around 30 days) along with weekly follow-up telephone calls. Supplemental home visits will be used as necessary over the 12 week period. At the first home visit the social workers will conduct a comprehensive in-home assessment and link patients and caregivers to local resources as necessary. Patients also assigned to the website will have access to a patient-centered online information and support resource called the Virtual Stroke Support Portal (VSSP). The investigators hypothesize that this personalized case management program will reduce patient and caregiver needs, improve quality of life, and decrease caregiver stress. The MISTT study will enroll 315 acute stroke patients discharged from 3 Michigan hospitals and will be completed by the end of 2017.","detailedDescription":"To improve care transitions for acute stroke patients this pragmatic, community-based, randomized, open clinical trial will test the efficacy of two separate but complementary interventions against usual care. The parallel group design will compare the following 3 groups:\n\n1. Usual care\n2. Stroke Case Manager (SCM): trained social workers who provide home based case management services\n3. SCM services plus access to the Virtual Stroke Support Portal (VSSP) an online information and support resource.\n\nThis patient-level randomized trial will be conducted at 3 Michigan hospitals and will enroll a total of 315 acute stroke patients (105 per intervention group). Each hospital will enroll cases over an 18 month period. Randomization will be balanced within each hospital to ensure that an equal number of patients are assigned to the 3 groups. If the patient identifies a primary caregivers they will be contacted and enrollment accordingly.\n\nThe trial interventions begin once the patient returns home (= Day 1) and end 3 months later (= Day 90). Outcomes data will be collected by telephone at baseline (= Day 7) and at Day 90. Subjects who are enrolled but do not go home within 1 month (because they remain in a rehabilitation or Skilled Nursing Facility) will be dropped and replaced by new patients. Two primary patient-level outcome measures include the Patient Activation Measure (PAM), a measure of self-efficacy, and the PROMIS-10, a global quality of life scale. Two primary caregiver-level outcome measures include the Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale (BCOS) and depression (PHQ-9).\n\nBy adhering to the principles of pragmatic trials, this trial is designed to inform typical U.S. clinical practice, with outcomes that are directly relevant to patients and caregivers. Specifically, this trial is designed to answer the practical question of whether the transitional care experience of stroke patients and caregivers can be improved by social workers who visit the home, and whether their effectiveness can be enhanced by a comprehensive patient-centered online resource."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["acute stroke","care transitions","patient engagement","patient education","caregivers","social workers"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":320,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Usual Care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients in this group will receive the hospitals' usual transitional care approach."},{"label":"SCM","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"One intervention is provided:\n\n1.
