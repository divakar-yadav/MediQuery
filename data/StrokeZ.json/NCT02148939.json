The incidence of chronic pain correlates with increased age. Most of patients rely on analgesic medication to control the pain. Dipyrone is an extensively used drug in Western and Eastern Europe as well as Central and South America, largely due to its favorable analgesic and antipyretic effects in conjunction with a low incidence of gastrointestinal complications when compared to other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\nAspirin is the backbone of antiplatelet therapy in patients after ischemic stroke. However, it is known that there are substantial inter-individual response variabilities to antiplatelet medication. Furthermore, patients with impaired response to aspirin have a significant higher risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events. The investigators have recently shown that co-medication with aspirin and dipyrone in patients with coronary artery disease lead to insufficient antiplatelet effects of aspirin.\n\nThe incidence of chronic pain is very high in patients with ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study the investigators aim to examine, if co-medication of aspirin and dipyrone interaction also occurs in patients after ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","Antiplatelet Effects","aspirin","metamizole","dipyrone"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":61,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Laboratory response to aspirin therapy in metamizole co-medicated Stroke patients","timeFrame":"Baseline"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE Events) during hospital stay","timeFrame":"participants are followed until discharge up to 4 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age ≥ 18 years\n* Patients with ischemic stroke and ASS-medication (80-320 mg/day) with/without analgesic comedication\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Reanimation\n* cardiogenic shock","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"patients with ischemic stroke","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Amin Polzin, MD","affiliation":"Klinik für Kardiologie, Pneumologie und Angiologie, Universtiätsklinikum Düsseldorf","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Tobias Zeus, MD","affiliation":"Klinik für Kardiologie, Pneumologie und Angiologie, Universtiätsklinikum Düsseldorf","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Division of Cardiology, Pulmonary Disease and Vascular Medicine","city":"Düsseldorf","zip":"40225","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":51.22172,"lon":6.77616}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"27301652","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Dannenberg L, Erschoff V, Bonner F, Gliem M, Jander S, Levkau B, Kelm M, Hohlfeld T, Zeus T, Polzin A.
