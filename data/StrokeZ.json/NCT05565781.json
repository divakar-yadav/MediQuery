Prolonged ambulatory cardiac monitoring is recommended for detecting occult AF. Currently, there are non-invasive monitoring devices such as the textile Holter that have proven to be useful for monitoring for up to 30 days but not longer. Another alternative is smartwatches, although they must be validated for use in the elderly population who have had a stroke.","detailedDescription":"The primary objective is to demonstrate that the protocol of ambulatory cardiac monitoring with wearable devices for 12 months allows detection of a higher percentage of occult AF than monitoring for 30 days. The secondary objectives will be to demonstrate the internal validity of smartwatches against insertable cardiac recorders for the detection of AF. To evaluate the usability and adherence to the use of smartwatches in patients with stroke. Detect predictors that can help detect long-term occult AF. Determine the profile of vascular events in each group. Detect predictors of vascular recurrence defined as stroke recurrence, incidence of cerebral hemorrhage, heart failure, myocardial infarction or vascular death."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation","Cryptogenic Stroke"],"keywords":["Wearable Electronic Devices"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ECG Smartwatch for up to 1 year","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Cardiac monitoring with an ECG Smartwatch over 1 year after the acute phase of cryptogenic stroke.
