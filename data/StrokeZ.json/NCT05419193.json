Stroke associated pneumoniaSAP and other infections limited the overall efficacy of stroke management. Increasing evidence suggests that sympathetic nervous system activity contributes to post post-stroke immunosuppression and emergence of infections. This study is designed to test the safety and efficacy of an adrenergic β receptor blocker propranolol in reducing SAP in hemorrhagic stroke patients, in a multi-center, randomized, open-labeled, end point-blinded, trial.","detailedDescription":"This study will enroll 168 intracerebral hemorrhage patients who meet the inclusion criteria.\n\nICH patients meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio into groups of standard treatment (blank-controlled), or propranolol hydrochloride injection .\n\nPatients allocated to experimented group will be intravenously given initial dose at 5mg propranolol hydrochloride daily over a course of 7 consecutive days, The primary purpose of this study is to compare propranolol hydrochloride with standard treatment on reducing the 7-day risk of pneumonia when initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset in intracerebral hemorrhage.\n\nBoth intent analysis (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) were used for analysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Vascular Accident","Intracranial Hemorrhages","Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Hemorrhagic Stroke","Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Stroke","propranolol","infection","treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Parallel Assignment","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Single (Outcomes Assessor)","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":168,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients will receive usual care and drug use in hospital.","interventionNames":["Other: control group"]},{"label":"Propranolol group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Propranolol hydrochloride will be administered intravenously via pump at a initial dose of 5mg/day over a course of 7 consecutive days after randomization.","interventionNames":["Drug: Propranolol Hydrochloride"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Propranolol Hydrochloride","description":"Day of randomization:\n\npropranolol IV vp for 7 days after randomization","armGroupLabels":["Propranolol group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"control group","description":"Patients will receive usual care and drug use in hospital","armGroupLabels":["Control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of stroke-associated pneumonia","description":"Stroke-associated pneumonia diagnosed in accordance to a defined algorithm.","timeFrame":"up to 7days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical improvement","description":"Modified Rankin Scale （mRS，0-6 scores, poor outcome defined as mRS≥4）are used to describe the clinical improvement at baseline, 7days, 14days, 30days and 90days.","timeFrame":"up to 90 days"},{"measure":"Change in immunology function [ Time Frame: up to 7 days ]（ONLY patients recruited from Beijing Tiantan hospital and Tangdu Hospital, Air Force Medical University will receive this evaluation）","description":"Use the flow cytometry to measure the change of ratio and number of CD4+、CD8+、NK 、B cells at baseline, 3 days, 7 days","timeFrame":"up to 7 days"},{"measure":"Spleen volume [ Time Frame: up to 7 days ] （ONLY patients recruited from Beijing Tiantan hospital and Tangdu Hospital, Air Force Medical University will receive this evaluation）","description":"Spleen volume calculated based on Abdominal CT.","timeFrame":"up to 7 days"},{"measure":"Adverse Event (AE)","description":"Per protocol Adverse Event (AE), Adverse Reaction (AR), Serious Adverse Event / Reaction (SAE / SAR), and Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR)","timeFrame":"up to 90 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
