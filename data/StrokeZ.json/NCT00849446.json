However, whether accelerometry is a valid and reliable tool in stroke needs to be established. From literature becomes clear that existing accelerometers show shortages at patients with stroke because of the specific deficits that these patients have.\n\nPurpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the validity and test-retest reliability of the SenseWear Pro armband as an objective measurement of physical activity in chronic stroke patients.\n\nPatients and Methods Subjects: Fifteen patients and fifteen healthy subjects will be included in the study following written informed consent. The following demographic and clinical data were recorded: age, gender, height, length, medication use, self-reported handedness, Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, Rivermead Gross Function, Functional Ambulation Categories, medical and surgical history.\n\nMethods: During one test session the subjects had to carry out an amount of activities according to a standardised protocol existing of lying down, sitting, standing, walking, step exercise and cycling. These activities are presenting activities of daily living.\n\nMeasures:Subjects wear on both arms a SenseWear Pro Armband. De data from these measuring devices will be compared with the data retrieved from 2 Yamax pedometers and the ergospirometry device. The outcome measures are: counts, heartbeat, oxygen used, energy expenditure, METabolic equivalent, time lying down.","detailedDescription":"Evaluation of the SenseWear Pro Armband to assess physical activity in individuals with chronic stroke\n\nBackground:\n\nAccelerometry has only recently been introduced in clinical stroke research.
