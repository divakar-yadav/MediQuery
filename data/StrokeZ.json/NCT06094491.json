Diabetes group visits (GVs)-virtual group education and diabetes support, including goal setting-create a unique setting where patients can connect with peers and receive medical care and support. GVs can improve glycemic control and decrease healthcare utilization. GVs can provide patients with comprehensive care for their multimorbid chronic condition.\n\nVirtual GVs provide an opportunity to adapt to the current trends of telehealth and the ability to increase reach and scalability across multiple sites. Before the model can be widely adopted, important questions about the effectiveness and implementation of the virtual diabetes GV model need to be addressed. The investigators propose to build on an established program of diabetes GVs. This proposal aims to implement the virtual GV model (VIDA: Virtual Diabetes Group Visits Across Health Systems) in two distinct health systems in the Chicago region. Access Community Health Network (ACCESS) is one of the largest federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in the United States with 35 sites across the Chicago metropolitan area, providing care for 175,000 medically underserved and low-income patients each year, including over 25,000 patients with diabetes and 30,000 patients who are uninsured; 60% of ACCESS' patients are Hispanic and 30% are African-American. Advocate Health Care (ADVOCATE) is a large, diverse, integrated private not-for-profit health system that includes 26 hospitals and more than 500 ambulatory sites. The system provides care across more than 129 primary care clinics in Illinois serving over 117,000 patients, of which 27% identify as African American/Black and 15% identify as Hispanic/Latino. Both are community-based health systems serving low-income and communities of color in Chicago and are network partners of the Chicago Chronic Condition Equity Network (C3EN).\n\nNo studies have systematically implemented virtual diabetes GVs for adults with T2DM in the real-world primary care setting or across distinct health systems. The ability to train, implement, and evaluate virtual GVs across systems with different care models provides the opportunity to learn about adaptation and the barriers and facilitators for implementation. This proposed study will compare virtual diabetes GVs to usual care using a type I hybrid effectiveness-implementation design via a pragmatic cluster randomized trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["T2DM (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus)","Hypertension","Heart Disease Chronic","Stroke","Hyperlipidemias","Peripheral Vascular Diseases","Obesity"],"keywords":["virtual group visits"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Type I hybrid effectiveness-implementation cluster randomized trial among adult patients with T2DM across 9 intervention sites and 9 control sites","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":720,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Virtual Group Visit Arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"These subjects will attend 6 monthly virtual group visits hosted by ACCESS or Advocate research staff.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Virtual Group Visit"]},{"label":"Usual Care Arm","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"These subjects will receive usual diabetes care at ACCESS or Advocate health centers."}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Virtual Group Visit","description":"Group visits must have these core components: diabetes education, group social support and goal setting.","armGroupLabels":["Virtual Group Visit Arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"A1c","description":"This is blood test that measures the percent of glucose and hemoglobin bound together.","timeFrame":"12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Systolic blood pressure","description":"Systolic blood pressure measures the arterial pressure","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Body Mass Index","description":"Measure of body fat based on height and weight","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Low density lipoproteins","description":"a measure of cholesterol in the blood","timeFrame":"12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient at a participating clinic (at least one visit in year prior to first GV)\n* Type 2 diabetes\n* ≥ 18 years old\n* A1C\\>8% within 6 months prior to first GV (we will first recruit patients with A1C\\>9%, then if spaces still available A1C\\>8.5%, then if spaces still available A1C\\>8%)\n* At least one additional cardiovascular condition (hypertension, heart disease, stroke, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, or BMI ≥ 30)\n* English or Spanish speaking\n* PCP assented to recruiting patient\n* Patient provides written consent","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Melanie Norstrom","role":"CONTACT","phone":"(773) 702-3962","email":"mnorstrom@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu"},{"name":"Arshiya Baig, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"773-834-4760","email":"abaig@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Arshiya Baig, MD","affiliation":"University of Chicago","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"17925588","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Zgibor JC, Peyrot M, Ruppert K, Noullet W, Siminerio LM, Peeples M, McWilliams J, Koshinsky J, DeJesus C, Emerson S, Charron-Prochownik D; AADE/UPMC Diabetes Education Outcomes Project.
