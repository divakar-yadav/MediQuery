Variations in blood flow according to the positioning of the patient's body are measurable using a transcranial Doppler.\n\nThe main objective is to verify whether intracerebral hemodynamic changes during early verticalization after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack are more frequent in patients with carotid stenosis or occlusion compared to those without stenosis or occlusion."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Verticalization","Doppler","Intracranial hemodynamic","Cerebral artery velocity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cases","description":"Patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack who have carotid stenosis greater than 50% NASCET (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) or an occlusion.","interventionNames":["Other: Transcranial Doppler"]},{"label":"Controls","description":"Patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack who do not have carotid stenosis greater than 50% NASCET (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) or an occlusion.","interventionNames":["Other: Transcranial Doppler"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Transcranial Doppler","description":"Initially, the patient will be placed in a strict supine position (at 0°) in his hospital bed in the USINV, according to the usual care.
