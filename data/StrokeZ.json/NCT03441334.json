Both groups will then go through a 10 week (24 sessions) of gait training with body weight supported treadmill. For the high frequency rTMS group, they will receive 5 Hz rTMS applied to bilateral motor areas prior to each gait training session. For the sham rTMS group, they will receive a sham stimulation prior to the gait training sessions. All participants will receive another comprehensive assessment after the training concludes. The assessor will be blinded to the intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High Frequency rTMS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The High Frequency rTMS group will receive real repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in 5Hz at 90% of resting motor threshold delivered to the bilateral motor areas via a figure of 8 air-filmed coil.
