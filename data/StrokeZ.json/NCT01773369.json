One 'opportunity' presented by a brain injury early in life compared to later in adulthood is that the young brain is much more plastic (malleable) and receptive to interventions. This is particularly true for neural circuits that are still under development. We will test the hypothesis that early (\\<2 yr old), intensive leg training will improve walking more than no training or training at \\>2 yr old. We will further determine the changes induced by training in motor and sensory pathways.","detailedDescription":"Children 8 mo to 3 yr old with unilateral perinatal stroke will be randomized into either: 1) Immediate Training, or 2) Delayed Training groups. The Immediate Group will train for 3 mo shortly after recruitment. The Delayed Group will go through the same measurements from the time of recruitment and at 3 mo later (with no training in between) to obtain a 3 mo change score which will serve as a control measure for the Immediate Group. The Delayed Group will also train after the 3 mo delay, when all control measures have been taken. Comparison of the improvements made by children who started training \\<2 yr old with those \\>2 yr old will answer the question if training at \\<2 yr old is better than \\>2 yr old. Finally, to determine if there are long term effects of this training, we will compare outcomes of these trained children with another group of children with the same injuries but no intensive training (i.e., too old for the training study), when all children turn 4 yr old. Clinical, kinematic and electrophysiological measures will be taken to help us understand not only the efficacy of the treatment, but also the neural mechanisms that might underlie improvements in outcome.\n\nWe are measuring outcomes at multiple times because change scores are of most interest. All children change as they age, so it is critical that we compare the change score with and without intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Perinatal Stroke"],"keywords":["cerebral palsy","physical therapy","rehabilitation","hemiplegia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":33,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Early treatment group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"These children will undergo the intervention (i.e., early leg training) shortly after recruitment.
