Participants will receive stimulation to each of 3 different brain areas combined with a session of arm exercise.","detailedDescription":"Small improvements in affected arm movement can be made with intensive physical practice. These improvements could potentially be enhanced by combining non-invasive brain stimulation with practice.\n\nTo develop such an intervention, it is necessary to understand which brain areas should be stimulated in which types of patients. It is probably more beneficial to target one side of the brain vs. the other, for example, depending on the characteristics of the stroke.\n\nThis study will examine the effect of stimulating one side of the brain vs. the other on the amount of improvement that occurs from physically practicing functional arm movements."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis","Cerebral Vascular Accident","Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["arm","rehabilitation","non-invasive brain stimulation","transcranial magnetic stimulation","upper extremity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Each participant will receive stimulation targeting each brain area.
