The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with a 90-day modified Rankin scale (mRS) of 0-1.\n\nStudy intervention: (1) Participants in the experimental group will receive intra-arterial alteplase (a dose of 0.225 mg/kg and a maximum dose of 20 mg) after the mechanical thrombectomy, and will receive standard medical treatment after the procedure. (2) Participants in the control group will receive standard medical treatment without intra-arterial alteplase.\n\nA total of 324 participants are anticipated to be recruited for this study, with 162 participants in each group (1:1 ratio)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute Ischemic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":324,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intra-arterial alteplase","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the experimental group will receive a 15-minute continuous infusion of intra-arterial alteplase at a drug concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. 15 minutes after the start of intra-arterial thrombolysis, the infusion will be stopped and an angiogram will be performed to assess the eTICI score.
