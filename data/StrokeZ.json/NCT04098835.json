ASCEND includes 24 total computer training sessions of 30 minutes each, for a total of 12 hours. ASCEND includes 8 coaching sessions of 45 minutes each. The computer exercises aim to improve attention, working memory (WM), and cognitive control through a series of engaging and interactive computer games (e.g., card games, driving simulation). The homework exercises and coaching sessions aim to assist the participant in generalizing and transferring skills from the computer exercises to daily life and to develop further strategies to compensate for attention and WM difficulties in daily life.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: ASCEND"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"ASCEND","description":"ASCEND is a behavioral intervention that combines computer-based cognitive exercise, strategy coaching with a neuropsychologist, and homework exercises in order to improve attention, working memory, and cognitive control after stroke.","armGroupLabels":["ASCEND"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Participant satisfaction with ASCEND, as measured by the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8)","description":"The CSQ-8 is a self-report measure of participant satisfaction with the intervention.
