If these classes prove to be effective, online platforms could be a viable avenue for those with CNI to exercise and increase/maintain wellness without having to leave their homes. The investigators are also attempting to determine if a class with a live instructor vs a pre-recorded class has an effect on motivation, compliance, exertion and modifications/safety.\n\nThe entire process, including screening and consenting, will be done via Zoom and Redcap, potentially providing a blueprint for the future studies. This process can enable participants to participate in studies with minimal inconvenience, expense and effort of traveling for the consent process."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neurologic Disorder","Stroke","Spinal Cord Injuries","Cerebral Palsy","Hemiplegia","Hemiparesis","Multiple Sclerosis","Parkinson Disease","Trauma, Brain","Transverse Myelitis","Friedreich Ataxia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"One group will attend live zoom classes with instructor feedback, and the other group will exercise using pre-recorded sessions.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Live zoom exercise classes","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will engage in a live zoom exercise session.
