Given this now rich therapeutic arsenal, it seems necessary to evaluate practices in local care in the field and the impact of these on the prognosis of ischemic stroke victims. The aim of this observational study is to compare these different care practices without interfering with the choice of strategy.\n\nA blood sample will also be taken at different times to study the value of growth differentiation factors (GDF) 8, 11 and 15, and Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor as prognostic biomarkers"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":821,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ischemic stroke patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Biological: prise de sang","Other: quality of life questionnaire"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"prise de sang","armGroupLabels":["Ischemic stroke patients"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"quality of life questionnaire","armGroupLabels":["Ischemic stroke patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of handicap","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Serum levels of biomarkers of stress","timeFrame":"Changes compared with baseline levels at Day 1, Day 3, Day 7"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with symptomatic ischemic stroke defined according to WHO criteria and treated by intravenous thrombolysis at the stroke ICU at Dijon CHU, intravenous thrombolysis by telemedicine with subsequent transfer to the Dijon stroke ICU, and/or endovascular thrombectomy at Dijon CHU)\n* Patients aged over 18 years.\n* Patients who have provided written informed consent to take part in the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who refuse to take part in the study.\n* Subjects in custody.\n* Patients (or a person of trust) who cannot be contacted by telephone during the follow-up.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"CHU Dijon Bourgogne","city":"Dijon","zip":"21079","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":47.31667,"lon":5.01667}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"},{"id":"D000002544","term":"Cerebral Infarction"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000020520","term":"Brain Infarction"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"},{"id":"D000007238","term":"Infarction"},{"id":"D000009336","term":"Necrosis"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","asFound":"Ischemic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9972","name":"Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5483","name":"Cerebral Infarction","asFound":"Ischemic Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21995","name":"Brain Infarction","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11974","name":"Necrosis","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
