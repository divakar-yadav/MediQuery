In the last decade, two easy-to-apply prediction models for gait were developed: the EPOS model in the Netherlands and the TWIST model in New Zealand. Although the models' performance in the development cohorts was good, this does not automatically mean that the models are ready for application in clinical practice, as it is unknown whether their performance is also good in an independent cohort from a different country and with different patient characteristics. Such external validation is an essential step towards clinical implementation of prediction models.\n\nA mobility-related problem is the occurrence of falls after stroke. Walking is among the Top 3 activities during which stroke patients fall, with the other two activities being transferring or sitting in a wheelchair. Especially soft tissue injuries after a fall are common and in 1-15% of the patients, the fall results in a fracture. Apart from the costs that arise from these injuries, falls have a negative impact on the patient's physical functioning and psychological status, with an increased dependency and fear of falling, resulting in a reduced quality of life.\n\nA systematic review found 12 studies that developed fall risk prediction models for either inpatient rehabilitation stroke patients or those living in the community. Important predictors for falls are the presence of hemi-inattention, fall history and balance deficits. However, none of the models had an acceptable performance and predictors were not always captured by a validated assessment, which is an important prerequisite for an unbiased prediction model.\n\nThe primary aim of this study is to externally validate the EPOS and TWIST models for independent gait after stroke in a heterogeneous sample of subjects admitted to the hospital with an acute stroke. It is hypothesized that the performance of both models in this independent cohort will be lower than in the development cohorts, but still be adequate.\n\nThe secondary objective is to investigate the occurrence and predictability of falls within the first six months after stroke and its relationship with the prognosis for independent gait within this sample."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Gait","Prognosis","External validation","EPOS model","TWIST model","Falls"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cohort","interventionNames":["Other: Standard stroke acute care and rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Standard stroke acute care and rehabilitation","description":"According to Swiss national guidelines and local protocols","armGroupLabels":["Cohort"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Functional Ambulation Categories (0-5 points, higher scores being better)","description":"Walking ability (independence)","timeFrame":"6 weeks poststroke"},{"measure":"Functional Ambulation Categories (0-5 points, higher scores being better)","description":"Walking ability (independence)","timeFrame":"12 weeks poststroke"},{"measure":"Functional Ambulation Categories (0-5 points, higher scores being better)","description":"Walking ability (independence)","timeFrame":"26 weeks poststroke"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Falls","description":"Number of falls","timeFrame":"6 weeks poststroke"},{"measure":"Falls","description":"Number of falls","timeFrame":"12 weeks poststroke"},{"measure":"Falls","description":"Number of falls","timeFrame":"26 weeks poststroke"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (0-42 points, lower scores being better)","description":"Neurological functions","timeFrame":"Hospital admission, usually within 24 hours poststroke"},{"measure":"Trunk Control Test (0-100 points, higher scores being better)","description":"Trunk control","timeFrame":"within 72 hours poststroke"},{"measure":"Motricity Index - lower extremity subscale (0-100 points, higher scores being better)","description":"Lower extremity isometric muscle strength","timeFrame":"within 72 hours poststroke"},{"measure":"Medical Research Grading - hip extension (0-5 points, higher scores being better)","description":"Hip extension muscle strength","timeFrame":"within 72 hours poststroke"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale (0-5 points, lower scores being better)","description":"Global disability","timeFrame":"6 weeks poststroke"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale (0-5 points, lower scores being better)","description":"Global disability","timeFrame":"12 weeks poststroke"},{"measure":"Modified Rankin Scale (0-5 points, lower scores being better)","description":"Global disability","timeFrame":"26 weeks poststroke"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion criteria:\n\n* First-ever or recurrent stroke as confirmed by computerized tomography and/ or magnetic resonance imaging\n* Not able to walk independently within the first 72 hours after stroke (Functional Ambulation Categories \\<4)\n* Age ≥18 year\n* Written informed consent\n\nExclusion criterion:\n\n• Not able to walk independently before hospital admission (Functional Ambulation Categories \\<4)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Admitted to a hospital with an acute stroke","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Janne M.
