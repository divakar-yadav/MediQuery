It neutralizes limb weight, enabling patients to use residual control in both arm and hand and to follow exercises guided by simulations of real-life challenges. The Armeo Spring incorporates wrist pronation and supination, allowing patients to enhance functional reaching patterns.\n\nAim of the study is to compare the Armeo device with standard physiotherapy in chronic patients with acquired brain lesions.\n\nThe result of the trial should show which treatment is more effective in the clinical practice. A significant better outcome of one arm should suggest to follow one treatment strategy more than the other."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Vascular Accident, Brain","Traumatic Brain Injury"],"keywords":["stroke","tbi","rehabilitation","upper limb"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Armeo Spring","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Armeo Spring"]},{"label":"conventional physiotherapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: conventional physiotherapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Armeo Spring","description":"30min Armeo Spring + 15min task oriented therapy over 6 weeks Frequency: 3 x/week","armGroupLabels":["Armeo Spring"],"otherNames":["group A"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"conventional physiotherapy","description":"30min occupational therapy(15min ADL-training, 15min repetitive training) + 15min task oriented therapy over 6 weeks Frequency: 3x/week","armGroupLabels":["conventional physiotherapy"],"otherNames":["group B"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl Meyer Score for sensorymotor recovery of the upper limb after stroke","timeFrame":"Enrollment"},{"measure":"Fugl Meyer Score for sensorymotor recovery of the upper limb after stroke","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Fugl Meyer Score for sensorymotor recovery of the upper limb after stroke","timeFrame":"6 weeks"},{"measure":"Fugl Meyer Score for sensorymotor recovery of the upper limb after stroke","timeFrame":"8 weeks"},{"measure":"Fugl Meyer Score for sensorymotor recovery of the upper limb after stroke","timeFrame":"12 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Upper Extremity Motor Activity Log for measuring real use of the upper limb","timeFrame":"Enrolment"},{"measure":"Upper Extremity Motor Activity Log for measuring real use of the upper limb","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Upper Extremity Motor Activity Log for measuring real use of the upper limb","timeFrame":"6 weeks"},{"measure":"Upper Extremity Motor Activity Log for measuring real use of the upper limb","timeFrame":"8 weeks"},{"measure":"Upper Extremity Motor Activity Log for measuring real use of the upper limb","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function Test for measurement of timed joint-segment movements","timeFrame":"Enrolment"},{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function Test for measurement of timed joint-segment movements","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function Test for measurement of timed joint-segment movements","timeFrame":"6 weeks"},{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function Test for measurement of timed joint-segment movements","timeFrame":"8 weeks"},{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function Test for measurement of timed joint-segment movements","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Clinical Global Impression Score for the measurement of change over time of the illness' severity","timeFrame":"Enrolment"},{"measure":"Clinical Global Impression Score for the measurement of change over time of the illness' severity","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Clinical Global Impression Score for the measurement of change over time of the illness' severity","timeFrame":"6 weeks"},{"measure":"Clinical Global Impression Score for the measurement of change over time of the illness' severity","timeFrame":"8 weeks"},{"measure":"Clinical Global Impression Score for the measurement of change over time of the illness' severity","timeFrame":"12 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 6 month after the onset of disease\n* acquired brain lesions in adults with upper limb hemiparesis\n* modified Ashworth \\<= 3\n* muscular strength MRC =\\>1 mano;
