Berg Balance Scale and Trunk Impairment Scale will be included with Turkish Ottawa Sitting Scale to test the validity. Outcome measures will be repeated by a second physiotherapist the day after the first assessment for interrater reliability and conducted twice within 2 weeks (test-retest) for reliability.\n\nThe interrater and intrarater reliability of the Ottawa sitting scale will be determined using intraclass correlation coefficients and internal consistency will be assessed using Cronbach's alpha."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fall Due to Loss of Equilibrium","Acute Stroke","Balance; Distorted","Fear"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Ottawa sitting scale","description":"The Ottawa Sitting Scale is a performance-based balance measurement consisting of 10 items that aims to evaluate the sitting balance in a comprehensive, specific, efficient and functional manner."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Ottawa sitting scale","description":"A balance measurement scale for acute stroke patients.
