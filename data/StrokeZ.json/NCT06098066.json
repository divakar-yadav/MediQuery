This groundbreaking study, the first nationwide, population-based analysis with long-term follow-up in an Asian context, dives deep into this critical question. Leveraging an expansive dataset from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, the investigators scrutinize the efficacy and risks of aggressive surgical interventions-specifically, EC-IC bypass, CEA, and CAS-in a cohort of over 84,000 patients.\n\nThis paper serves as a milestone, bridging the gap between medical idealism and clinical reality. It calls for a surgical renaissance, emphasizing the need for refining techniques and enhancing patient selection protocols. If participants're looking for a comprehensive, nuanced, and, above all, actionable insight into the surgical treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular disease, this is the study that could redefine the paradigm."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["Ischemic Cerebrovascular Disease","EC-IC Bypass","Carotid Endarterectomy","Carotid Artery Stenting","Nationwide Cohort Study","Risk-Benefit Analysis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":204411,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"control"},{"label":"ECIC bypass"},{"label":"CEA"},{"label":"CAS"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"rehospitalization","description":"rehospitalization due to ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke","timeFrame":"Follow-up assessments were planned at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years post-index date"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cardiac events","description":"congestive heart failure and acute myocardial infarction were also monitored throughout the study period.","timeFrame":"Follow-up assessments were planned at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years post-index date"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n- All participants underwent either a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within two days before or after hospital admission.\n\nThe date of the first ischemic stroke hospitalization served as the index event.\n\nAmong these patients, those who underwent surgical interventions post-hospitalization were categorized into three distinct groups: CEA (ICD-9-CM code 3812), CAS (ICD-9-CM code 3990), and EC-IC (ICD-9-CM code 3928), with the operation date being the index date.\n\nThose who did not receive any surgical interventions were considered the non-intervention control group and had their first hospitalization date as the index date.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n- patients with a history of: any stroke subtype (ICD-9-CM codes 430-434), Moyamoya disease (ICD-9-CM code 437.5), cancer (ICD-9-CM codes 140-239), trauma (various ICD-9-CM codes), transient ischemic attack (ICD-9-CM code 435), unruptured cerebral aneurysm (ICD-9-CM code 437.3), or subarachnoid hemorrhage (ICD-9-CM code 430).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"The cohort comprises all inpatients hospitalized between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2010, diagnosed with a first stenosis-occlusion ischemic stroke (ICD-9-CM codes 433-434).
