The experimental group receive basic treatment and remote ischemic conditioning for 200mmHg, 2 times per day for 7 consecutive days. The control group receive basic treatment and remote ischemic conditioning control for 60mmHg, 2 times per day for 7 consecutive days. Both groups underwent dynamic cerebral autoregulation measurements at days 1,3,and 7 of onset and recorded the relevant indexes. We aimed to determine the effect of serial remote ischemic conditioning on dynamic cerebral autoregulation in patients with intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"RIC+Standard medical treatment","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"RIC+Standard medical treatment.
