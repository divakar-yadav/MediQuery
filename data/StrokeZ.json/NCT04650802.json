The aim of this study was therefor to investigate the effect of a five-week gait training on paretic propulsion, propulsion symmetry, gait capacity, and daily-life mobility and physical activity in chronic stroke survivors. We hypothesize that the robotic gait training will improve propulsion symmetry and, thereby, gait speed and functional gait tasks. In addition, we expect that improved gait capacity might lead to less impact of stroke on daily-life mobility and a higher physical activity level. Thirty-three chronic stroke survivors with impaired paretic propulsion (≥8% difference in paretic vs. non-paretic propulsive impulse) will be enrolled in this proof-of-concept study. Participants receive five weeks individual robotic gait training targeting paretic propulsion (60 minutes, two time a week). The robotic gait training is complemented with daily home exercises (15 minutes/day) focusing on increasing strength and practice of learned strategies in daily life. Propulsion measures, self-selected gait speed, performance on functional gait tasks, and daily-life mobility and physical activity are assessed five weeks (T0) and one week (T1) before the start of the intervention, and one week (T2) and five weeks (T3) after the end of the intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Gait","Rehabilitation","Robotics","Propulsion","Speed","Biomechanics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Longitudinal intervention study with two consecutive baseline assessments and a five-week follow-up","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":29,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Gait training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants receive five weeks individual robotic gait training in LOPES II, targeting paretic propulsion (60 minutes, two time a week).
