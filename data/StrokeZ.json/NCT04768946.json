In addition, the study will determine ways to adapt our current home safety virtual simulation training system, a game based training and assessment that trains home healthcare workers to identify and respond to hazards they encounter in client homes. The study will include interviews with three stakeholders groups: adolescents with ABI, parents of adolescents with ABI, and healthcare providers working with adolescents with ABI to identify home safety hazards encountered by adolescents with ABI. We will demonstrate proof of concept for adolescents with ABI through assessment of safety concerns from multiple perspectives and evaluation of design considerations from our intended user-group. Further, we are applying the HH-VSTS in a novel way to solve an understudied problem in adolescents with ABI. In addition, we will apply a user-centered, participatory approach to assess the design consideration of virtual gaming technologies to health and safety training adolescents with ABI."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acquired Brain Injury","Traumatic Brain Injury","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":29,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Adolescents with Acquired Brain Injury","description":"Adolescents with traumatic brain injury, stroke, and other acquired brain injury ages 12 - 17 will participate in interviews about home safety.
