Preliminary brain tissue motion measurements from a small number of patients suggest that brain biomechanics may be disturbed in the presence of injury. This study combines Transcranial Tissue Doppler ultrasound with brain MRI to establish whether analysis of brain tissue motion provides clinically useful information for emergency diagnosis and monitoring of acute brain injury."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acquired Brain Injury","Traumatic Brain Injury","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":250,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Transcranial Tissue Doppler (TCTD)","description":"Doppler ultrasound technique called 'Brain Tissue Velocimetry\" (Brain TV), to investigate brain tissue motion over the cardiac cycle."},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Brain MRI","description":"Brain MRI for investigation of brain tIssue motion in the presence of acute acquired brain injury."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"TCTD measurement","description":"The study will generate a library of Brain TV measurements for exploratory (descriptive) analysis and imaging of brain tissue pulsations in patients with acquired brain injury (ABI) to evaluate the potential for clinical device development.","timeFrame":"Up to 5 days."},{"measure":"MRI measurement","description":"This study will perform brain MRI for brain tissue motion for selective patients with acquired brain injury","timeFrame":"Up to 5 days."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participant (or consultee) is willing and able to give informed consent (or assent) for participation in the study.\n* Adult, aged 18 years or over.\n* Suspected Acquired Brain Injury (any severity).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Unable (in the investigators' opinion), or unwilling, to comply with the study requirements.\n* Patients with pre-existing chronic brain conditions that may make affect informed consent, such as severe learning difficulties, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease, will be excluded.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Participants with suspected acute acquired brain injury will be identified and recruited by the Emergency Department (ED) research team and/or members of the direct care team within the Hyper Acute Stroke Unit (HASU).","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Emma M Chung, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"01162525839","email":"emlc1@le.ac.uk"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Emma M Chung, PhD","affiliation":"University of Leicester","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Leicester","zip":"LE1 5WW","country":"United Kingdom","contacts":[{"name":"Emma Chung","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+44 1162525839","email":"emlc1@le.ac.uk"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":52.6386,"lon":-1.13169}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001930","term":"Brain Injuries"},{"id":"D000070642","term":"Brain Injuries, Traumatic"},{"id":"D000004630","term":"Emergencies"},{"id":"D000014947","term":"Wounds and Injuries"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000020969","term":"Disease Attributes"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000006259","term":"Craniocerebral Trauma"},{"id":"D000020196","term":"Trauma, Nervous System"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7486","name":"Emergencies","asFound":"Emergency","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4897","name":"Brain Injuries","asFound":"Brain Injury","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M628","name":"Brain Injuries, Traumatic","asFound":"Traumatic Brain Injury","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M17375","name":"Wounds and Injuries","asFound":"Injury","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M22390","name":"Disease Attributes","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9039","name":"Craniocerebral Trauma","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21713","name":"Trauma, Nervous System","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC26","name":"Wounds and Injuries"}]}},"hasResults":false}
