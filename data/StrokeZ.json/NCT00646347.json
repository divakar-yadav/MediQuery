We attempt to apply such an orthosis on stroke patients to aid in regaining movement from severe paralytic arm by helping the patients to support their wrist and finger in a functional position for grasping. The patient is then encouraged to produce voluntary movement from the severe paralytic arm to transport an object (ball) from place to place either in sitting or standing position.\n\nSince intensive arm usage is associated with neuro reorganisation, we propose designing a program with the neuro hand to encourage usage of the paralysed hand and help overcome the barriers of poor motivation and lack of arm usage through self practice program."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Paralytic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","upper limb rehabilitation","treatment","movement recovery from sever paralytic upper limb","neuro hand orthosis","self practice program","subacute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Conventional stroke upper limb rehabilitation is given","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional upper limb stroke rehabilitation"]},{"label":"B","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Neuro Hand Orthosis Program is given","interventionNames":["Device: Neuro Hand Orthosis Program (NHOP)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional upper limb stroke rehabilitation","description":"Patient will be given a ten weeks conventional upper limb therapy. 3 sessions will be provided weekly in the first 4 weeks and 2 therapy sessions will be provided weekly in the subsequent 6 weeks.

This successful experience will positively reinforce the patient to continue to use their paralytic arm and change the patient's behavior and perception in the arm usage.\n2.
