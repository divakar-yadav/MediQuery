It does not matter how mild or severe a person's aphasia is, they can be a good candidate for CPT as long as their communication partner is motivated and willing to adapt their communication style. The objective of this study is to see the effects of communication partner training for the management of persons with aphasia. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted. In total, 6 dyads will be randomly assigned to the intervention (CPT program) or usual care (control) group. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) V 25. will be used for Data analysis. Results will be extracted. Conclusion will be made after comparing the pre and post treatment results on person with aphasia.","detailedDescription":"Communication Partner Training (CPT) is an evidence-based intervention that teaches communication partners (e.g., family members, friends, healthcare workers) how to best support conversation and interaction for a person with aphasia. It does not matter how mild or severe a person's aphasia is, they can be a good candidate for CPT as long as their communication partner is motivated and willing to adapt their communication style. The objective of this study is to see the effects of communication partner training for the management of persons with aphasia. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted. In total, 6 dyads will be randomly assigned to the intervention (CPT program) or usual care (control) group. The intervention group received usual care in addition to a CPT program, which consisted of face-to-face education and counselling sessions, a manual and telephone support. Data will be collected at baseline, three months, and six months. The main outcome for caregivers will be using appropriate conversational skills that will be measured by the Conversational Skills Rating Scale (CSRS). Secondary outcomes for patients will be health-related quality of life that will be measured by the Quality of Life (QOL) Scale. To see the effective communication between patient and communication partner, Communicative Effectiveness Index (CETI) will be used."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aphasia"],"keywords":["Aphasia","Post Stroke","Communication Partner Training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Communication Partner Training:The group will receive usual care in addition to a CPT program, which will consist of face-to-face education and counselling sessions, a manual and telephone support.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Communication Partner Training"]},{"label":"Comparison Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will receive usual speech therapy sessions.","interventionNames":["Other: Usual Speech and language Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Communication Partner Training","description":"This intervention aims to improve the language, communication, participation and overall quality of life of the Person with Aphasia.","armGroupLabels":["Experimental"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Usual Speech and language Therapy","description":"This group will receive usual speech and language therapy session.","armGroupLabels":["Comparison Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Conversational Skills","description":"Enhanced Communication skills in terms of attentiveness, expressiveness, coordination and composure.
