There is a great potential to significantly improve the treatment and care of these patients in a time economic way by telemonitoring the therapy in home environment.\n\nThis study is planned to prove that telephone consultancy and motivation in times of recorded decreasing CPAP therapy usage can improve adherence, neurological function and quality of life.","detailedDescription":"Eligible patients with confirmed OSA from neurological rehab department of Helios Clinic Hagen Ambrock are asked to join the study. They will be randomly assigned to one of two arms \\[CPAP with Telemonitoring (MTM) or without Telemonitoring (OTM)\\] for 6 months of home treatment after hospital discharge. The MTM arm will receive supporting phone calls when the monitored usage time decreases."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["OSA","Apoplexy"],"keywords":["OSA","Apoplexy","CPAP","adherence","telemonitoring"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Unattended CPAP therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Therapy data will be examined by reading out the CPAP device after 6 months.
