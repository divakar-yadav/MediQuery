For relearning and functional training, the required activities require motor control and must comply with the following principles: movements close to normal, muscular activation, movement conduction, focused attention, repetition of desired movements, specificity of training, intensity and transfer. These principles underlie the most widely used conventional physiotherapy intervention programs in the hospital setting.\n\nAdvances in technology have made it possible to start using immersive VR in the therapeutic approach to various pathologies that affect motor function.","detailedDescription":"Physiotherapy intervention programs in the post-stroke patient should develop strategies to assess functional deficit, prevent poorly adaptive plasticity and maximize functional gain. For relearning and functional training, the required activities require motor control and must comply with the following principles: movements close to normal, muscular activation, movement conduction, focused attention, repetition of desired movements, specificity of training, intensity and transfer. These principles underlie the physiotherapy intervention programs specifically most used in the hospital setting.\n\nMain aims\n\n1-To determine if the designed immersive VR training program is better in the short term (15 sessions) and in the medium term (30 sessions) than the conventional physiotherapy training with respect to the change of the parameters related to the static balance in sitting and standing and dynamic balance in post-stroke patients.\n\nSecondary aims 2. To determine the efficacy in the short term (15 sessions) and in the medium term (30 sessions) of immersive VR systems compared to conventional physiotherapy procedures regarding the quality of life associated with stroke, the degree of independence and autonomy .\n\n3. To determine the safety of the application of training programs in immersive VR settings in post-stroke subjects with respect to the number of adverse effects produced.\n\n4. Determine prognostic factors associated with insufficient improvement (less than moderate change) after stroke treatment with the designed immersive VR program and with conventional physiotherapy treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Balance","Stroke","Physical Therapy","Virtual Reality"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":44,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Virtual reality","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"1. st part: Conventional physiotherapy treatment program aimed at achieving functional improvement and increased postural control. 15 minutes\n2. nd part: Experimental training program for static and dynamic balance in sitting and standing by immersive Virtual Reality. 15 minutes","interventionNames":["Other: Virtual reality"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"1. st part: Conventional physiotherapy treatment program aimed at achieving functional improvement and increased postural control.15 minutes\n2. nd part: Training program for static and dynamic balance in sitting and standing, according to Bayouk. 15 minutes","interventionNames":["Other: Control group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Virtual reality","description":"Use of virtual reality glasses for balance work","armGroupLabels":["Virtual reality"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control group","description":"Balance treatment with according to Bayouk physiotherapy","armGroupLabels":["Control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (PASS).","description":"Static balance and functional mobility, This consists of 12 items and is subdivided into two parts: mobility (7 items) and balance (5 items), each with a score ranging from 0 (minimum) to 3 (maximum); the total scale score is 36 points.\n\nThe PASS is made up of 12 items of increasing difficulty, of a 4-point scale in which items are scored from 0 to 3.
