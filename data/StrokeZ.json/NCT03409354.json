The previous RCT was also limited to stroke patients. In addition to stroke, there are many other conditions (such as fractures, lower limb joint replacement, musculoskeletal conditions) require and benefit from rehabilitation. The primary aims of the pilot evaluation study are: (i) To document patient adherence to TR, compared to usual care (ii) To estimate the extent to which TR improves functional status, compared to usual care and (iii) To estimate the cost effectiveness of TR, compared to usual care in eight different health conditions in Singapore.","detailedDescription":"This is a 12-week quasi-experimental trial of a tele-rehabilitation program involving seven sites and up to 600 adults in Singapore."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fractures, Bone","Stroke","Lower Limb Joint Replacement (Hip or Knee)","Lower Limb Amputation","Pneumonia","Fall","Deconditioning","Musculoskeletal Conditions (e.g., Tendinitis, Capsulitis)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":14,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tele-rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Tele-rehabilitation via iPad.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Tele-rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Usual care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Usual rehabilitation care, prescribed by rehabilitation therapists at participating centers and performed by participants at participating centers.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Usual care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Tele-rehabilitation","description":"There are five different categories of exercise in the rehabilitation program, which combines both physiotherapy (Category 1 to 4) and occupational therapy components (Category 5).
