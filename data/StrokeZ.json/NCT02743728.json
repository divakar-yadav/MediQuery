Motor signs that indicate the infant is beginning to develop CP often do not become evident for several months after the diagnosis of perinatal stroke which delays therapy. The main purpose of this study is to examine early brain reorganization in infants 3-12 months of age corrected for prematurity with perinatal stroke using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In addition, the association between the brain reorganization and motor outcomes of these infant participants will be identified.\n\nIn this study, the MRI scans will include diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) - an established method used to investigate the integrity of pathways in the brain that control limb movement. Infants will be scanned during nature sleeping after feeding. The real scanning time will be less than 38 minutes. TMS is a painless, non-surgical brain stimulation device which uses principles of electromagnetic induction to excite cortical tissue from outside the skull. Using TMS as a device to modulate and examine cortical excitability in children with hemiparetic CP and in adults has been conducted previously.\n\nIn this infant study, we will assess cortical excitability from the motor cortex of both the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres under the guidance of a frameless stereotactic neuronavigation system. Additionally, the investigators will assess infants' movement quality using an age-appropriate standardized movement assessment. This will allow the investigators to examine the relationship between measures of motor pathway integrity and early signs of potential motor impairment. We will longitudinally follow enrolled infants, and complete repeat assessments at 12- and 24-months corrected age to assess how infants develop over time after perinatal stroke. The remote follow-up will occur at 5 years or less.","detailedDescription":"Understanding the early brain reorganization before the brain has not yet largely reorganized is critical for developing efficacious early intervention. As a unique aspect of investigation, this study will combine Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)/ Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and TMS to provide an additional opportunity to assess both the cortical excitability and corticospinal tract (CST) integrity in infants with perinatal stroke.\n\nIdentifying the association between laboratory assessment results and developmental outcomes is also critical. This study is to use MRI/DTI and TMS to comprehensively examine both the CST integrity and cortical excitability in infants following perinatal stroke, and to identify association with motor outcome as evaluated by movement assessment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["perinatal stroke","transcranial magnetic stimulation","magnetic resonance imaging","diffusion tensor imaging","non-invasive brain stimulation","infant"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"All Infants","description":"Each infant will receive an Magnetic Resonance Imaging, then Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Cortical Excitability testing, and General Movement Assessment.
