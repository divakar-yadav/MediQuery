BMI is a device that can record and analyze human brain signals (in this study Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used) and also provide live feedback (by pneumatic glove movement) to the individual wearing it. This device hypothetically enables more accurate training by reinforcing the correctly activated brain signal repeatedly then conventional therapy.\n\nIn phase 1 study investigators will evaluate the feasibility of BMI on chronic stroke participants. 5 sessions of BMI-assisted occupational therapy (OT) will be performed and the Fugl Meyer Assessment-Upper Limb (FMA-UL) score change between the pre-treatment and post-treatment will be analyzed by paired t-test.\n\nIn phase 2 study, a randomized controlled study will be performed by randomly allocating participants to either control (OT plus OT) or experimental group (BMI-assisted OT plus OT) and the difference of FMA-UL score change between the two groups will be analyzed by Student's t-test."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiplegia"],"keywords":["Neural plasticity","Brain Machine Interface","Functional near-infrared spectroscopy","Stroke","Upper extremity","Function","Recovery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Phase1 (chronic stroke): with-in group (one group) multiple measurements Phase2 (subacute stroke): Randomized controlled study.
