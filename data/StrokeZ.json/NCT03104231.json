The usage of oral anticoagulation (OAC) may prevent the incidence of the thromboembolic events in the majority of patients. The current guidelines for the management of AF patients highlight the important role of patients' education, since the clinical benefit from OAC treatment may be achieved by the effective cooperation between patients and physicians. It has been suggested, that compliance may be increased by the novel e-solutions introduced into the daily clinical practice. Due to the improvement in advanced technologies, the virtual reality (VR) three-dimensional (3D) movie stands for a future alternative in e-medicine. The aim of the OCULUS study was to examine whether the 3D movie-based knowledge transfer is effective in teaching patients about the consequences of AF and pharmacological possibilities in reducing the risk of stroke.","detailedDescription":"The OCULUS is a prospective, single centre study. The study will include hospitalized patients, who are over 18 years old. The only exclusion criteria of the study is the previously diagnosed dementia. The study is based on the questionnaire designed by the authors of the study, enclosing questions about sex, age, education, current job, AF history and knowledge about consequences of AF and the possibility of stroke prevention due to the OAC therapy. Subsequently, the brief VR-3D will be shown using the oculus glasses and a smartphone. The movie's plot informs about the risk of stroke and importance of the OAC therapy to prevent the incidence of the thromboembolic complications of AF. Consequently, patients will be asked several questions, including what was the movie about, whether AF can affect patient's life in a negative way, is it possible to reduce the risk of stroke and by what kind of drugs. Similar questions will be asked to the patients immediately after the movie, one week and one year later, via the Telephone follow-up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["mHealth"],"keywords":["atrial fibrillation","oral anticoagulantion","stroke prevention","education","e-medicine"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"study group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All the patients will be shown three-dimensional (3D) movie.","interventionNames":["Other: three-dimensional (3D) movie"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"three-dimensional (3D) movie","description":"Brief VR-3D will be shown using the oculus glasses and a smartphone.
