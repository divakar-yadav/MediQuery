By doing this study, we hope to learn how vascular risk factors cause memory and thinking changes in the elderly, and whether we can prevent memory and thinking changes by reducing these risk factors. Successful completion of project aims will allow an integrated understanding of mild cognitive impairment caused by vascular risks (MCI-CVD) with the potential for tremendous impact on one of the major healthcare crises facing the nation today.\n\nThe study will enroll 80 participants with memory and thinking problems (mild cognitive impairment; MCI) and are at risk for stroke and further difficulties with memory and thinking that may eventually lead to disability and a diagnosis of dementia. Each participant will be randomized into one of two groups (40 in each group) and followed over 36 months. One group will be followed to allow us to understand the natural history of memory and thinking impairment, while the other group will receive intensive education and assistance with vascular risk factor (CVD) control.","detailedDescription":"This is a randomized, controlled study of intensive medical management and educational programming (Heart Health Intervention) for controlling stroke and vascular risks that may impact your thinking and memory (MCI-CVD). This means that if you choose to enroll, it will be determined by chance ( pulling a number from a hat) whether you will receive the study intervention or standard-of-care treatment. One-half of all subjects will be enrolled in the intervention, while the other one half will not. You will have a 50:50 chance of receiving the intervention, like the flip of a coin. You will be in the study for 36 months if you enroll.\n\nEven if you do are not in the study group receiving medical management and educational programs, we will be monitoring your risks for stroke and vascular risks every 6 months and this information will be provided to your primary doctors, potentially resulting in an increased level of care as a result of your participation in this study.\n\nYou must have an individual (spouse, friend, or relative), called a \"study partner\", who is willing to accompany you to all of the study visits or be available by telephone to communicate changes in your health status over the period of this study.\n\nThe study visits include checking vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate weight), regular blood testing at 6 month intervals to monitor your vascular risks (blood sugar, cholesterol levels)as well as ensure your safety throughout the study, yearly brain imaging with MRI scans, and optional spinal fluid collection at enrollment and end of study to help us understand brain changes that cannot be measured in blood."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Disease","Mild Cognitive Impairment"],"keywords":["stroke, dementia, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, obesity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"No Intervention","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"A placebo cohort of 40 subjects with MCI related to vascular risk factors (MCI-CVD) will be followed longitudinally with cognitive, imaging, blood and optional spinal fluid biomarkers providing insight into the natural disease course of MCI-CVD.
