PASE has shown to be reliable and valid in different populations of people between 65 and 100 years of age and after stroke. However, its validation on stroke was based on another self report questionnaire that assess physical activity (PA) called ''Senior Fitness Test''. There are four methods to measure physical activity: 1. Self-Report Questionnaires 2.Self-Report Activity Diaries/Logs 3.Direct Observation 4. Devices (Accelerometers, pedometers, arm band, Heart-Rate Monitors). Accelerometers can measure PA accurately and have ability capture large amounts of data. Accelerometers measure acceleration (activity counts:AC) in real time and detect movement in up to three orthogonal planes (anteroposterior, mediolateral, and vertical) These counts are then translated into a metric of interest, which can be biological (e.g. energy expenditure) or PA patterns (e.g. stationary). There are pros and cons of measurement methods of physical activity. Strengths of accelerometers include minute-by-minute on-line monitoring, capturing intensity level. Accumulated AC provide an accurate estimate of the duration and intensity of body movement at the waist and were summed across the whole day to assess total PA volume. However, accelerometers are expensive and require technical expertise, specialized hardware, software, and individual programming. Self-report PA measurement methods are able to measure large numbers of participants at low cost. Since accelerometers are more objective methods to assess PA, to the best of our knowledge, self-report physical activity questionnaires should be validated based on accelerometer derived physical activity data. The aim of this study is to validate PASE in patients with stroke based on accelerometer data."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","physical activity","accelerometer","physical activity scale for elderly"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with subacute chronic stroke","description":"Patients with subacute chronic stroke between the ages of 40-80","interventionNames":["Device: Actical accelerometers (Philips Respironics)","Other: PASE"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Actical accelerometers (Philips Respironics)","description":"patients with stroke will be evaluated by using PASE scale and accelerometer results (accelerometer will be held from Monday to Friday","armGroupLabels":["Patients with subacute chronic stroke"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"PASE","description":"Physical Activity Scale for Elderly","armGroupLabels":["Patients with subacute chronic stroke"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"PASE","description":"Physical Activity Score for Elderly","timeFrame":"Day 0"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"ACtotal","description":"Total activity count obtained from accelerometer","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"EE total","description":"Total energy expenditure obtained from accelerometer","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"AC moderate","description":"activity counts derived from accelerometer during moderate physical activity","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"EE moderate","description":"energy expenditure obtained from accelerometer during moderate physical activity","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"AC light","description":"activity counts derived from accelerometer during light physical activity","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"EE light","description":"energy expenditure obtained from accelerometer during light physical activity","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"AC vigorous","description":"activity counts derived from accelerometer during vigorous physical activity","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"EE vigorous","description":"energy expenditure obtained from accelerometer during vigorous physical activity","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"AC sedentary","description":"activity counts derived from accelerometer during sedentary physical activity","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"EE sedentary","description":"energy expenditure obtained from accelerometer during sedentary physical activity","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"step count","description":"total step count obtained from accelerometer","timeFrame":"Day 0"},{"measure":"Stroke Impact Scale total score","description":"Stroke Impact Scale is a stroke specific quality of life scale.

Domains are scored on a metric of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better self-reported health. Four of the scales of the SIS can be combined into a composite physical domain (strength, hand function, physical and instrumental activities of daily living, and mobility), with scores also presented on a 0 to 100 metric.","timeFrame":"Day 0"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
