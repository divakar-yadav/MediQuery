They excluded those who had less than six months of injury, with sensory or perceptual deficit. Patients included were randomized into two groups, a treatment group, which conducted rehabilitation with virtual reality associated with conventional physical therapy and the control group that performed only conventional physiotherapy. Randomization was done by a computer program in blocks, by a third person, respecting the allocation concealment. After selection and randomization, patients were evaluated at baseline, when they were collected demographic and clinical data, investigated the occurrence of falls in the three months prior to evaluation and rated the balance in motion using the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI). Patients were followed for 20 physiotherapy sessions, visits twice a week for an hour each. The assessment of the balance and the investigation of the occurrence of falls were repeated at the end of treatment, which occurred on average three months after the start of the intervention, by the same examiner, who remained blind to the group that the patient belonged."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Virtual reality","Balance","Falls"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Virtual Reality Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Rehabilitation with virtual reality using games with balance training goal.","interventionNames":["Other: Virtual Reality","Other: Conventional"]},{"label":"Conventional Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Conventional physiotherapy with exercises for balance training.","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Virtual Reality","description":"Rehabilitation with virtual reality, using Football games, Boxe, Bambolê and Tennis.","armGroupLabels":["Virtual Reality Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional","description":"Stretching exercises in limbs, trunk mobilization in the three planes, balance training in standing position, training of balance reactions and gait training.","armGroupLabels":["Conventional Group","Virtual Reality Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Dynamic Gait Index (DGI)","description":"Balance during gait in patients after stroke undergoing rehabilitation with virtual reality associated with conventional physiotherapy.","timeFrame":"avarage 8 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Falls","description":"falls in patients after stroke undergoing rehabilitation with virtual reality associated with conventional physiotherapy.","timeFrame":"avarage 8 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients of both sexes with hemiparesis after stroke of 18 to 65 years.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* less than 6 months of injury with sensory or perceptual deficit.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Erika Fonseca","affiliation":"Pedreira, Érika, M.D.","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
