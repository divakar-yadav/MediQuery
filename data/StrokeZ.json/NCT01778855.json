Secondary exploratory analyses include imaging of the neurovascular impact of reperfusion with hypothermia and tPA, including blood-brain barrier changes or permeability, hemorrhagic transformation, and infarct growth.","detailedDescription":"A prospective imaging ancillary study coincides with recruitment of ICTuS 2 by using currently available imaging tools at a subset of multicenter sites. HASTIER will evaluate therapeutic response with imaging outcome measures for recanalization and reperfusion. Key scientific objectives include the evaluation of hypothermia on benchmark recanalization and reperfusion rates in 120 cases of middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. Recanalization will be measured with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score change from baseline-36 hour CT/MRI angiography. Reperfusion will be measured with Tmax \\> 6s lesion volume change from baseline-36 hour CT/MRI perfusion imaging. Secondary outcomes will be measured with serial changes in permeability abnormalities derived from CT/MRI perfusion imaging, hemorrhagic transformation, and infarct growth from baseline-36 hours. Correlation of these imaging parameters with clinical outcomes will provide insight to accelerate research during these translational steps in hypothermia treatment for acute ischemic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","hypothermia","thrombolysis","imaging","collateral circulation","recanalization","reperfusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Normothermia","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"IV t-PA and normothermia","interventionNames":["Other: IV t-PA and normothermia"]},{"label":"Hypothermia","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"IV t-PA and hypothermia","interventionNames":["Device: IV-tPA and hypothermia"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"IV t-PA and normothermia","armGroupLabels":["Normothermia"],"otherNames":["t-PA as standard of care and normothermia"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"IV-tPA and hypothermia","armGroupLabels":["Hypothermia"],"otherNames":["Hypothermia is induced using the Celsius Controlâ„¢ System and IV-tPA administered"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants With Recanalization","description":"To determine whether hypothermia alters recanalization with standard thrombolytic treatment with intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for acute ischemic stroke in humans.
