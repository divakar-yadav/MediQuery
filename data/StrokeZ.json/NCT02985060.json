The subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned to the treatment group or the control group. The randomization ratio is 1:1. The subjects of the treatment group will receive a 2-day hypothermia therapy followed by the process of recovery of temperature within 30 hours (the recovery phase). After 3 months of the onset of symptoms, mRS scores are measured. This is followed by the closure of the clinical trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Thrombolytic Therapy"],"keywords":["Therapeutic hypothermia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Therapeutic hypothermia group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Therapeutic hypothermia using surface cooling device (Arctic Sun) Stroke care based on international guidelines except therapeutic hypothermia using surface cooling device (Arctic Sun)","interventionNames":["Device: Arctic Sun","Drug: Saline"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"OTHER","description":"Stroke care based on international guidelines","interventionNames":["Other: Standard treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Arctic Sun","description":"1.
