Stroke survivors and healthy control individuals will be recruited to analyze motor learning in the upper extremity and its neural basis in early stroke recovery.","detailedDescription":"In stroke rehabilitation, clinicians guide the relearning of motor skills to promote recovery and improve function. A common assumption is that motor learning interacts with processes that are involved in tissue repair and helps to engage neuroplastic mechanisms that promote recovery. One of the biggest roadblocks for advancing the treatment of motor deficits is that we do not understand how motor learning changes after stroke, and critically, if poor recovery is due to a loss in an individual's ability to adapt or learn. Existing clinical tests do not directly assess motor learning. This means that therapists can profile stroke impairments (motor, sensory, cognitive, etc.) but cannot directly measure a patient's ability to learn, which is likely an important factor in recovery.\n\nThe RELEARN trial will pair robotics, an objective tool to assess post-stroke arm impairment, with neuroimaging to link motor learning deficits with possible influencing factors (sensory, motor, cognitive function) and damage in specific brain areas.\n\nParticipants with stroke will undergo clinical and robotic evaluations at baseline (within 1-13 days post-stroke), at 6 weeks, at 12 weeks, and again at 26 weeks. An MRI assessment will occur during week 6. Stroke participants will complete a 24hr retention assessment after baseline visit and week 26 visit.\n\nControl participants will undergo a single robotic evaluation and a 24hr retention assessment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Neuroimaging","Motor Learning","Early Stroke Recovery","Neuroplasticity","Limb Dominance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke Participants","description":"This group will include stroke survivors from the Calgary Stroke Program who are over 18 years of age.","interventionNames":["Other: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)","Device: Kinarm Robotic Exoskeleton Assessment","Other: Clinical Assessment"]},{"label":"Control Participants","description":"This group will include healthy individuals from the community who are matched for age and sex to stroke participants.","interventionNames":["Device: Kinarm Robotic Exoskeleton Assessment","Other: Clinical Assessment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)","description":"A research MRI will be performed at 6-weeks post-stroke to document stroke lesion location and size.","armGroupLabels":["Stroke Participants"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Kinarm Robotic Exoskeleton Assessment","description":"The Kinarm Robotic Exoskeleton is a device used to provide therapy and assessment.
