A number of 30 patients aged 40-70 will be included. Within 48 hours of the event, blood inflammatory biomarkers, and scalp hair sample for cortisol will be taken. All recruited patients will undergo full neurological examination and the severity of the stroke will be rated using NIHSS (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale). 3 months and one year later neurological examination and rating of neurological disability will be determined using Rankin Scale."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Stroke"],"keywords":["acute cerebrovascular stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Anti Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha","description":"single blood sample will be drawn to measure Anti Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha levels (pg/ml).","timeFrame":"24 months"},{"measure":"C-reactive protein levels","description":"single blood sample will be drawn to measure c-reactive protein levels (mcg/dl).","timeFrame":"24 months"},{"measure":"Hair Cortisol level","description":"single hair sample will be drawn to measure cortisol levels (mcg/dl)","timeFrame":"24 months"},{"measure":"INL-6","description":"single blood sample will be drawn to measure INL-6 levels.","timeFrame":"24 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"TSH","description":"single blood sample will be drawn to measure Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (mcIU/ml).","timeFrame":"24 months"},{"measure":"FT4","description":"single blood sample will be drawn to measure Free Thyroxine (pmol/L) .","timeFrame":"24 months"},{"measure":"FT3","description":"single blood sample will be drawn to measure Free Triiodothyronine (pmol/L).","timeFrame":"24 months"},{"measure":"Cortisol","description":"single blood sample will be drawn to measure cortisol levels (mcg/dl).","timeFrame":"24 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
