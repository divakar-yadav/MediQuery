Patients coming to the emergency department with bleeding in the brain not due to trauma or other known causes who can be treated within 6 hours of onset will undergo CT angiography using standard CT scanners (\"CAT scan\"). Those with a \"spot sign\", a type of marker on the CT scan that shows the brain is still bleeding, will be randomly assigned to a single injection of \"factor 7\"(a blood clotting drug used in hemophilia) or placebo (inactive saline); patients without a spot sign will not be treated. The researchers will look at how much bleeding happens after the treatments are administered, as well as clinical outcomes such as death and disability. The researchers think that factor 7 will cause the bleeding to stop faster and possibly decrease death and disability.","detailedDescription":"This phase II double blind RCT will enroll 110 patients from approximately 15 Canadian stroke centres. Acute ICH patients who can be treated within 6 hours of onset will undergo CT angiography using standard CT procedures. Those with a spot sign will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a single injection of rFVIIa 80 µg/kg or placebo; patients without a spot sign will not be treated. The primary endpoint is ICH expansion within 24 hours."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","ICH","Intracerebral hemorrhage","acute stroke","rfVIIa","Niastase"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Niastase RT","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Niastase RT 80ug/kg IV bolus","interventionNames":["Biological: rfVIIa"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"saline IV bolus","interventionNames":["Other: Standard saline solution"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"rfVIIa","description":"80ug/kg IV bolus","armGroupLabels":["Niastase RT"],"otherNames":["Niastase RT"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Standard saline solution","description":"Saline","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"],"otherNames":["Saline solution sourced from local hospital"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"ICH size","description":"Difference between groups in ICH size on CT scan at 24 hours post-dose, adjusted for baseline ICH size","timeFrame":"24 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Feasibility","description":"Percentage of sites who can meet recruitment targets of 2 patients per site per year; % patients who meet the target time of \\<45 minutes from emergency department arrival to the start of the scan; % patients who meet the target time of \\<60 minutes from the end of the CT angiogram to administration of study drug; Local site spot sign interpretation accuracy as judged by central adjudicator; protocol violations","timeFrame":"0"},{"measure":"Waiver of consent process evaluation/effectiveness","description":"Waiver of consent use, acceptability, and effect on treatment times.
