The participant is allocated randomly to One-day ECG monitoring group or the continuous ECG monitoring group for more than 8 days in ratio of 1:1, only if the participant provides informed consent and eligible for all the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The investigator confirms the results of MEMO Patch PLUS monitoring at 1 month from the date of MEMO Patch PLUS attachment. The participation of the subject is terminated on the 1 year from the date of MEMO Patch PLUS attachment. On that day, investigator evaluates incidence of the event associated with atrial fibrillation, the event is included ischemic stroke/transient ischemic accident, hemorrhagic stroke, systemic embolism, etc."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter in Patients With High Risk of Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Parallel Assignment","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MEMO Patch PLUS ECG monitoring for One-day","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: MEMO Patch PLUS for 1 day"]},{"label":"MEMO Patch PLUS ECG monitoring for More than 8-days","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: MEMO Patch PLUS for More than 8-days"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"MEMO Patch PLUS for 1 day","description":"Individuals randomized to one-day monitoring will wear MEMO Patch PLUS for 1 day.
