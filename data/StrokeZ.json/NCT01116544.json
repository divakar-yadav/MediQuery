However, the efficacy of these new therapies appears to be limited to relatively high-functioning chronic stroke patients. A therapeutic approach that may be efficacious in restoring functional movement to low-functioning chronic stroke patients is \"AMES,\" which stands for Assisted Movement with Enhanced Sensation. Despite the efficacy of AMES in restoring movement to low-functioning hemiparetic stroke patients, those with plegia at a joint tend not to recover movement in the plegic direction with AMES treatment or with other rehabilitation therapies. The objective of this study is to determine if AMES treatment in combination with biofeedback can be helpful in restoring functional movement to plegic stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Plegia","Paresis","Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["AMES device","Cerebrovascular Accident","Chronic Stroke","Rehabilitation","Upper Extremity","Biofeedback"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":46,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AMES therapy with EMG biofeedback","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The AMES device provides a 30 minute treatment period of alternating passive flexion and then extension of the hand while vibrators vibrate the muscles of the hand.
