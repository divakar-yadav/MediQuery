The literature reviews suggest that trunk exercises are required to achieve good trunk stability which is essential for balance, daily functional activities and higher function tasks. By keeping these facts in view present study aims at evaluating the efficacy of PNF techniques \\& conventional trunk exercise to improve trunk control in recovery stage hemiplegic patients Objective: To determine Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) Techniques to improve bed mobility, transfer and early trunk control in Stroke patients","detailedDescription":"50 patients was included and allocated into 2 groups, group A consisting of 25 patients who received PNF techniques for trunk to improve trunk control. Group B consisting of 25 patients who received conventional trunk exercises to improve trunk control.
