To obtain incidence data and evaluate the regional and international divergences\n2. To obtain the mortality data in short and long term. Since the onset of the registry, it has been implemented a study on the mortality of stroke patients of Brest Registry. This study has been realized independently for both types of stroke, i.e. ischemic and hemorrhagic, with different caused mortality. This mortality was studied at medium-term (≤ 28 days) as well as at long-term (\\> 28 days). There will be a collaboration project between Public Health Surveillance (InVS), Brest University Hospital and Rennes network on all causes of death.\n3. Pharmaco-epidemiology\n\nIn clinical terms, the registry offers an opportunity to do an inventory of all current practices (diagnosis, therapies and the subsidiaries) and propose in this manner the best management of stroke. This strategy is in line with the pilot programs deployed by the French High Health Authority (HAS) for improvement of quality and safety of the health care. The bleeding risk associated with anticoagulants and anti-platelet agents in people of Brest as well as that of Dijon and Lille (in collaboration with their respective registry) will be analyzed.\n\nThis study has gained a particular characteristic since 2012 with emerging new oral anticoagulants (OAC) which have shown less associated bleeding risks compared with vitamin K antagonists (randomized controlled trials).\n\n•In terms of clinical research :\n\n1. Study the impacted consequences of stroke by socio-economic characteristics of the territories in the Pays de Brest\n2. Identify short and long term clinical predictors of mortality in patients who have had a hemorrhagic stroke.\n3. To identify clinical predictors of mortality in the short and long-term patients with ischemic stroke.\n4. To identify genetic predictors of mortality and long-term recurrence of patients with ischemic stroke\n5. Identify stroke identification algorithm from existing databases"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral (CVAs)","Ischemic Cerebrovascular Accident","Stroke","Brain Ischemia","Brain Hemorrhage","Ischemic Stroke","Hemorrhagic Stroke","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"10 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Type of stroke (ischemic or haemorrhagic)","description":"The type of stroke ischemic or haemorrhagic will be collected from physician diagnostic","timeFrame":"Inclusion"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Patient outcome","description":"Patient outcome (mortality) wanted by mail from towns of birth","timeFrame":"Every year after the inclusion during 10 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnostic validated for one of the following pathologies:\n* Ischemic stroke,\n* Non-traumatic intracranial hematoma\n* Cerebral venous thrombosis Diagnostic after December 31, 2007 Age \\> 15 years on the date of the diagnostic Patient domiciled at the time of the diagnostic in one of the 79 communes defined beforehand\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age ≤ 15 years\n* Validated diagnosis (see below, § 4.2.2) of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage cerebrovascular\n* Diagnosis made before 1 January 2008\n* Unconfirmed diagnosis\n* Patient domiciled outside the previously defined area of residence","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"15 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Diagnostic validated for one of the following pathologies:\n\n* Ischemic stroke,\n* Non-traumatic intracranial hematoma\n* Cerebral venous thrombosis Diagnostic after December 31, 2007 Age \\> 15 years on the date of the diagnostic Patient domiciled at the time of the diagnostic in one of the 79 communes defined beforehand","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Serge TIMSIT","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+33298347620","email":"serge.timsit@chu-brest.fr"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Serge TIMSIT","affiliation":"CHRU La Cavale Blanche -
