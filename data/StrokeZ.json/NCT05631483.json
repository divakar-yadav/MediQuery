if a woman is of child-bearing potential and urine or serum beta HCG test is positive.\n* Severe contrast allergy or absolute contraindication to iodinated contrast.\n* Difficult endovascular access, difficult aortic arch or severe neurovascular tortuosity that will result in an inability to deliver endovascular therapy.\n* Evidence of dissection in the carotid or target artery for treatment.\n* Presence of a carotid artery stenosis or occlusion requiring balloon angioplasty or stenting at time of the procedure.\n* Renal failure (serum creatinine level ≥ 3 mg/dL or on dialysis).\n* Severe, sustained hypertension resistant to treatment (SBP \\>185 mmHg or DBP\\>110 mmHg).\n* Use of warfarin anticoagulation with International Normalized Ratio (INR) \\>3.0 at the time of the procedure or any known hemorrhagic or coagulation deficiency.\n* Use of a direct thrombin inhibitor within the last 48 hours; partial thromboplastin time (PTT) \\> 2.0 times the normal prior to procedure.\n* Cerebral vasculitis or evidence of active systemic infection.\n* Suspicion of aortic dissection, presumed septic embolus or suspicion of bacterial endocarditis.\n* Clinical symptoms suggestive of bilateral stroke or occlusions in multiple vascular territories (e.g., bilateral anterior circulation, or anterior/posterior circulation).\n* A severe or fatal comorbid illness that will prevent improvement or follow-up or that will render the procedure unlikely to benefit the patient.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Chris Pierzchalski","role":"CONTACT","phone":"2623910954","email":"cpierzchalski@mivineuro.com"},{"name":"Carlos Valverde, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"7863199950","email":"cvalverde@cosmosscientific.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Boris Pabon, MD","affiliation":"Angiosur","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Angiosur - Unidad Vascular Integral","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Itagüí","state":"Antioquia","country":"Colombia","contacts":[{"name":"Carlos Valverde, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+573008148383","email":"cvalverde@cosmosscientific.com"},{"name":"Boris Pabon, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Manuel Patino, MD","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":6.18461,"lon":-75.59913}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000083242","term":"Ischemic Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke, Acute","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2401","name":"Ischemic Stroke","asFound":"Stroke, Acute Ischemic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T170","name":"Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
