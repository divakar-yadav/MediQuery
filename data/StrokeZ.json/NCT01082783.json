Furthermore, the association between the severity and the phenotype of this autoimmune response and the clinical course, i.e. prognosis and mortality, will be investigated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke-induced immunodepression","acute media infarct","acute intracerebral bleeding","leucocytes","autoaggressive T-cells","acute media infarct or acute intracerebral bleeding"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"blood samples (serum and plasma)"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":28,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"patients with acute media infarct"},{"label":"controls with cardiovascular risks"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"autoantigen-specific T-cells in patients with acute media infarct","description":"quantitative determination of autoantigen-specific T-cells in patients with acute media infarct","timeFrame":"within 36 h"},{"measure":"leukocytes in patients with acute media infarct","description":"quantitative and qualitative analysis of leukocytes in patients with acute media infarct","timeFrame":"within 36 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"frequency and phenotype of CNS-autoreactive immune cells under the influence of immunodepression","timeFrame":"within 36 h, after day 3, 7, 90 and 180"},{"measure":"clinical course, i.e. mortality and prognosis (measured by mod.
