Persistent deficits in the distal upper extremity lead to impaired hand function and disability in Activities of Daily Living, accruing enormous costs in terms of health care services and lost productivity. The mechanisms of recovery of hand motor function after stroke are poorly understood, and the protocols used in clinical practice lack a solid scientific rationale. Prior work has shown that grasping with the non-involved hand may assist in planning of grasp with the involved hand after stroke. The goal of the proposed project is to investigate the type and nature of information relayed across the hemispheres by prior manipulation with the non-involved hand to improve planning and control of grasp with the involved hand. Psychophysical methods using a grip instrument will be used to examine the type of information necessary for planning of grasp, and quantitative surface electromyography will be used to investigate the contribution of improved planning to neuromuscular control of grasp. Integration of these methods in the study of grasp control will clarify the neural mechanisms underlying hand dysfunction, and facilitate the development of rational therapeutic protocols for upper extremity rehabilitation after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke With Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Brain Infarction","pathology","physiopathology","psychology","rehabilitation","Fingers","Grasp","Functional Laterality","Hand","Strength","Neuronal Plasticity","Psychomotor Performance","Biomechanis","Touch","Weight-Bearing"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":58,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","description":"stroke group","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Transfer of grasp control across hands"]},{"label":"2","description":"control group","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Transfer of grasp control across hands"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Transfer of grasp control across hands","description":"transfer of planning and execution of grasp across hands in terms of its effect on fingertip forces, and the timing and magnitude of muscle contraction in patients with hemiparesis and healthy controls","armGroupLabels":["1","2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Difference in peak load force rates for grasping a light and a heavy weight object as measured using a custom made object with 6 dof force sensors.","timeFrame":"immediately post-intervention"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Timing and magnitude of motor unit recruitment as measured by quantitative EMG of the grasping and lifting muscles.","timeFrame":"immediately post-intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

Subjects must obtain MRI or CT scan images of their brain taken since their stroke, or be willing to have a structural MRI or CT scan taken as part of this research study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Presence of clinically significant visual deficits, aphasia, neglect, or apraxia as determined by clinical neurologic examination that may interfere with the research protocol\n2. Presence of sensory deficits in control subjects and in the non-involved hand of stroke subjects on testing of two-point discrimination\n3. History of surgery or other significant injury to the upper extremities\n4. Botulinum toxin injections in the upper extremity musculature in the three months prior to enrollment in the study.\n5.
