There is preliminary evidence supporting the role of dry needling for spasticity in patients who had suffered from a stroke. Few data exists on the effects on shoulder pain. In addition, it has been shown that application of dry needling induces post-needling soreness in individuals with musculoskeletal pain. No previous study has investigated the presence and the duration of post-needling soreness in individuals who had experienced a stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dry
