Otherwise providing transradial approach is fraught with technical difficulties of common carotid artery canulation that can result in embolic complications. Taking into account the absence of studies in this area of medicine, providing investigation evaluating parameters of safety for both methodics is very actual."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Atherosclerosis","Carotid Stenosis","Ischemic Attack","Stroke","Bleeding"],"keywords":["Carotid atherosclerosis","Carotid stenosis","Ischemic attack","Stroke","Carotid stenting","Transradial approach","Transfemoral approach","Bleeding","Thromboembolism","Embolism","Neurocognitive disorders"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Carotid stenting, Transradial approach","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Internal carotid artery stenting using transradial arterial approach","interventionNames":["Procedure: Transradial carotid artery stenting"]},{"label":"Carotid stenting, Transfemoral approach","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Internal carotid artery stenting using transfemoral arterial approach","interventionNames":["Procedure: Transfemoral carotid artery stenting"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Transradial carotid artery stenting","description":"The radial artery is punctured with a trocar.
