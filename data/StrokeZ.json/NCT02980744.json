For many people with stroke who often have difficulty with walking, achieving that intensity of activity is difficult. The result is that people with stroke spend over 80% of their day in sedentary behaviours (too much sitting). A growing body of research shows that too much sitting has negative effects on health including larger waist circumference, unhealthy levels of blood glucose and insulin, heart disease, lower levels of functioning, and premature death.\n\nThis project tests a new approach to activity promotion that focuses on increasing light-intensity activity throughout the whole day while reducing sitting time. The new intervention is titled \"STand Up Frequently From Stroke (STUFFS)\" and is aimed at increasing self-confidence among people with stroke to sit less, stand up and walk around at frequent intervals during the day. Studies in the general population have shown that standing up and walking around frequently are beneficially associated with health indicators (lower waist circumference, lower blood fat and glucose levels). Encouraging people with stroke to reduce sitting and increase light-intensity activities appears feasible and sustainable and might be a first step to increase their daily energy expenditure.","detailedDescription":"Background: Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability among Canadians, with about 405,000 individuals living with the effects of stroke and this number is expected to rise by 80% in the next 20 years \\[1\\]. Guidelines on activity promotion in people with stroke emphasize the attainment of 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity per week \\[2\\].\n\nMoving fast enough to 'break a sweat' is challenging for people with stroke who often have mobility deficits. Stroke survivors spend over 80% of their day in sedentary behaviours (too much sitting) \\[3-5\\]. Accumulating evidence indicates that sedentary behaviour has deleterious effects on health, regardless of exercise levels \\[6\\]. Targeting sedentary behaviour might be a feasible and sustainable way to change activity behaviour in people with stroke.\n\nPurpose: This research aims to test the feasibility of a social cognitive theory-based intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour and improve light-intensity activity (such as standing and walking around frequently). The focus is on improving activity behaviour and will allow a systematic and staged reduction of contact with organised hospital care.\n\nMethodological approach: Thirty-five persons with stroke will be enrolled. Outcomes including sedentary behaviour, physical activity and function will be measured at baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 9) and follow-up (week 16). Activity behaviour (i.e. time sedentary, standing, and stepping) will be recorded for 7 days at each time point using activPAL activity monitor, validated in people with stroke \\[7\\]. Impairment from stroke will be assessed using Chedoke McMaster Stroke Assessment, which is a valid and reliable tool to measure impairment after stroke \\[8\\]. Cognitive status will be assessed using Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale, validated in stroke \\[9\\].\n\nAt the end of the intervention, feasibility outcomes such as reach (number enrolled / number eligible), retention (% enrolled who complete study), and satisfaction (exit interviews) with the program will be determined. Changes in sedentary, physical activity and functional outcomes across time (weeks 0, 9 and 16) will be tested.\n\nIntervention: For the intervention, output from baseline activity monitoring (using activPAL activity monitor) will provide data on usual activity behaviour. Action plans targeting areas of high sedentary behaviour throughout the day will be developed. A wrist-worn activity Misfit monitor - a motivational tool that will track adherence to the intervention will be used throughout the intervention period (i.e. 8 weeks). This device provides activity feedback for the user in real time. A checklist will be used to address: 1) use of walking aids; 2) incidence of falls; 3) review and progression of home exercise program; and 4) quality of walking.\n\nAnalysis: Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize baseline data. Feasibility measurements (reach, retention, and satisfaction) will be evaluated as percentages. Changes in activity and functional outcomes across time (weeks 0, 9 and 16) will be tested using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). All analysis will be done with STATA and significance level set at P \\< 0.05."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Sedentary behaviour","Intervention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"STUFFS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will undergo a sedentary behaviour intervention which includes breaking up prolonged sitting by standing and walking around for 5 minutes every half-hour, standing and walking during television commercial breaks, doing 2 sets of 10 sit-to-stand transitions three times per day, and going to the kitchen to grab some drink every hour.
