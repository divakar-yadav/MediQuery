Absence of biological marker used in current practice and identified as a prognostic factor for recovery. D-dimers are degradation products of stabilized fibrin translating an activation of coagulation whatever the cause. Studies have shown that increased D-dimer levels in patients with MI is associated with a higher mortality rate, the link with post-intervention non-revascularization has been demonstrate.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to search for a correlation between the level of D-dimer and the degree of recovery evaluated by the NIHSS score"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Infarction","Cerebral Infarction Recovery"],"keywords":["Cerebral Infarction","cerebral infarction recovery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"D-Dimer measurement in blood sample"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"blood sample","description":"D-dimer measurement in blood sample"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Correlation between D-dimer concentration and NIHSS score","description":"NIHSS score is based on the clinical neurological examination of the patient.
