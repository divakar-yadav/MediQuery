The study was designed as a prospective, double-blind, exploratory randomized controlled study. The entire study included a screening period and a treatment observation period ( a total of 24 weeks ). All patients with cerebral ischemia of TAK will be randomly divided into RIC group and sham RIC group at 1:1 ratio. On the basis of receiving the conventional drug therapy, the patients will be treated with RIC or sham RIC treatment twice daily for six month. The clinical data of patients at baseline and each follow-up will be collected, including basic information, disease activity assessment, laboratory indicators, imaging indicators, treatment data, adverse events, etc.The Primary outcome is the mean cerebral blood flow improvement rate ( mCBF-IR ) of TAK patients after 24 weeks-treatment. Secondary endpoints include the incidence of major adverse cerebrovascular events ( MACE ) , the change value of arterial transit time ( ATT ) in pCASL hypoperfusion area compared with baseline, occurrence of RIC-related adverse reactions, the changes of hematological indexes and disease activity score, etc. This study will provide insights into the preliminary proof of principle, safety, and efficacy of RIC in cerebral ischemia in patients with Takayasu arteritis ( TAK ), and this data will provide parameters for future larger scale clinical trials if efficacious.","detailedDescription":"Clinical symptoms, routine follow-up laboratory tests, other serological indicators (VEGF, NGF, ET-1, ACE), PAF, PDGF, etc.), vascular involvement, cranial MRI, vascular injury score, disease activity and treatment will be collected at baseline. After RIC or sham RIC intervention, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, disease activity, treatment and RIC-related adverse reactions will be collected at 1m, 2m,3m and 6m. the data of vascular involvement, cranial MRI, vascular injury score and disease activity will also be collected at 6 months follow-up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Ischemia","Takayasu Arteritis"],"keywords":["Cerebral Ischemia","Takayasu Arteritis","remote ischemic conditioning"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":44,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"RIC group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The RIC protocol includes five cycles of 5-min inflation to 200mmHg and 5-min deflation.","interventionNames":["Device: RIC"]},{"label":"sham RIC group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The sham RIC protocol includes five cycles of 5-min inflation to 60mmHg and 5-min deflation.","interventionNames":["Device: sham-RIC"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"RIC","description":"RIC is a non-invasive therapy that is performed by automated pneumatic cuffs placed on unilateral arms.
