This randomized controlled trial will be conducted in Stroke Center in Istinye University Liv Hospital-Bahcesehir. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to either the control group (receiving usual care/ routine follow-up group) or the intervention group (receiving nurse-led psychosocial program). A nurse- led program will be implemented for the management of psychosocial problems following a comprehensive evaluation. Then, the effect of this program on psychosocial problems and quality of life will be evaluated in the 1st and 3rd months after discharge.","detailedDescription":"The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of nurse- led program on psychosocial problems and quality of life in stroke patients. This randomized controlled trial will be conducted in Stroke Center in Istinye University Liv Hospital- Bahcesehir. Patients who meet the criteria will be randomized into the intervention group or control group. All patients will be assessed at discharge by use of following tools: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale, Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A nurse coordinated multidisciplinary program aiming to improve psychosocial problems has been developed and will be applied to the patients in the experimental group. This nurse-led program will start at discharge and continue for three months. The control group will be applied usual care. Two groups will be compared at baseline and at the 3rd month after discharge in terms of psychosocial variables and quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Psychosocial Problems"],"keywords":["Stroke","Psychosocial Problem","Nurse-led Program","Quality of Life"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Nurse- led program","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A nurse coordinated multidisciplinary program aiming to improve psychosocial problems has been developed and will be applied to the patients in the experimental group.
