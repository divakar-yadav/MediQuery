A previous audit using cerebral saturations at or above baseline showed improved neurological and length-of-stay outcomes.","detailedDescription":"This prospective, single centre, double-blinded controlled study randomized 182 consecutive patients, scheduled for cardiac surgical procedures using cardiopulmonary bypass. Participants were randomized by concealed envelope prior to anaesthesia. NIRS study group were managed perioperatively using our NIRS protocol. The control group had standard management without NIRS. Primary outcomes were post-operative neurological impairment and hospital length-of-stay. Secondary outcomes included ventilation times, intensive care unit length-of-stay, major organ dysfunction and mortality"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiac Surgery","Neural Injury","Cerebral Ischemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This prospective, single centre, double-blinded controlled study randomized 182 consecutive patients, scheduled for cardiac surgical procedures using cardiopulmonary bypass.
