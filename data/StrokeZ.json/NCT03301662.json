Prolonged continuous ECG monitoring is impractical and requires substantial resources while insertable cardiac monitors are invasive and costly. Chest and thumb-ECG could provide an alternative for atrial fibrillation detection post-stroke.\n\nThe primary objective of our study is to assess the incidence of newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation during 28 days of chest and thumb-ECG monitoring in patients with cryptogenic stroke. Secondary objectives are to assess Health-related Quality of Life using Short Form-36 and the feasibility of the Coala Heart Monitor in patients with stroke.","detailedDescription":"Stroke survivors in Region Gävleborg, Sweden, will be eligible for the study from October 2017. Patients with a history of ischemic stroke without documented atrial fibrillation before or during ECG evaluation in the stroke unit will be evaluated by the chest and thumb-ECG system Coala Heart Monitor. The monitoring system is connected to a smart phone application which allows for remote monitoring and prompt advice on clinical management. Over a period of 28 days, patients will be monitored twice daily and may activate the ECG recording at symptoms. Upon completion, the system is returned by mail. This system offers a possibility to evaluate the presence of atrial fibrillation post-stroke, but the feasibility of this system in patients who recently suffered from a stroke is unknown. In addition Health-related Quality of Life using Short Form-36 in comparison to Swedish population norms will be assessed. The feasibility of the Coala Heart Monitor will be assessed by a self-developed questionnaire."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation","Stroke"],"keywords":["atrial fibrillation","cryptogenic stroke","ECG screening","health-related quality of life","Short Form-36","stroke","thumb-ECG"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"chest and thumb- ECG","description":"chest and thumb- ECG using the Coala Heart Monitor"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cumulative incidence of atrial arrhythmia","description":"Cumulative incidence of atrial arrhythmia at 28 days.","timeFrame":"28 days (prospectively)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Previous atrial arrhythmia","description":"The prevalence of previously known atrial arrhythmia before cryptogenic stroke and the number of these patients who had anticoagulant therapy.","timeFrame":"10 years (retrospectively)"},{"measure":"Compliance with chest and thumb-ECG","description":"Compliance with chest and thumb-ECG at week four (number of recorded scheduled ECG tracings).","timeFrame":"28 days (prospectively)"},{"measure":"Patient-reported experience with chest and thumb-ECG","description":"Patient-reported experience with chest and thumb-ECG measured at week six","timeFrame":"6 weeks (prospectively)"},{"measure":"Health-related Quality of Life","description":"Health-related Quality of Life (Short Form-36) at week 6 and at 12 months and the association with atrial fibrillation and compliance with chest and thumb-ECG.","timeFrame":"12 months prospectively"},{"measure":"Cumulative incidence of stroke","description":"Cumulative incidence of stroke (and all-cause mortality) after three years in patients with atrial fibrillation versus without atrial fibrillation.","timeFrame":"3 years prospectively"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients, aged ≥18 years, with a validated diagnosis of ischemic cryptogenic stroke are eligible for the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* For screening with chest and thumb-ECG, exclusion criteria are as follows: previously known atrial arrhythmia with an indication for anticoagulation, implantable defibrillator, pacemaker or insertable cardiac monitor, pregnancy, permanent indication for anticoagulation (including low-molecular weight heparin) due to atrial arrhythmia, mechanical heart valve, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism.
