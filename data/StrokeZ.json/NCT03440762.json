Atrial fibrillation-related stroke will rise with the aging population and places enormous strain on healthcare resources and quality of life; yet they are highly preventable, by early detection of AF. Timely treatment reduces AF-related stroke risk by 68%, yet treatment is often delayed because people may not recognize the symptoms of AF or may be asymptomatic. Given the number of people at risk for development of AF and the dire consequences of untreated AF, efforts to promote early detection of AF through proactive screening of older adults at risk for AF have been successfully undertaken in Europe and Australia. However, little is known about the outcomes of conducting programs to screen for and educate people about AF in community settings in the US.\n\nPurpose: The purpose of this descriptive pragmatic study to evaluate the outcomes of a community placed AF screening and education program. Primary outcomes include feasibility, number of participants who screen positive for AF, and changes in participants' Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs about Atrial Fibrillation Self-Monitoring (KABAF-SM) scores from baseline to two-weeks after enrollment.\n\nMethods: Up to 250-participants who have at least two risk factors for developing AF and have no previous diagnosis of AF will be recruited from Midwest community settings and will be screened for AF using a mobile ECG recorder and will receive written information sheet about AF. A portion (up to 125) of those 250 participants will be invited to complete the KABAF-SM at baseline and 2-weeks after enrollment. Participants will have the option to participate in a variety of AF educational activities to reinforce and enhance the written information. Participants will be surveyed about their perceptions of the educational program after the screening and participating in the educational activities.\n\nEvaluation methods: Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze feasibility (enrollment numbers, participants perception of the value of the educational activities, time required for study procedures,and AF detection.T-tests will be used to test for differences between KABAF-SM baseline and two-week scores for those who completed the KABAF-SM."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atrial Fibrillation"],"keywords":["Screening","Education","AFib Awareness","Stroke prevention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Single group pre-post educational intervention","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":83,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AF awareness education","type":"OTHER","description":"AF awareness education face to face","interventionNames":["Behavioral: AF awareness education"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"AF awareness education","description":"Participants will receive education about a description of AF, complications, recognition of signs and symptoms of AF, pulse taking, and how to recognize an irregular pulse","armGroupLabels":["AF awareness education"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Feasibility-number enrolled","description":"number of participants enrolled","timeFrame":"5 months"},{"measure":"Feasibility-time required for study procedure","description":"Number of minutes require to perform mobile ECG","timeFrame":"5 months"},{"measure":"Participants' perception of the usefulness of the Learning Station activities","description":"The outcome will be measured by the Participant Perception of Learning Station Activities survey.

Total score range for the Likert items is 14-56. Perceived confidence is measured by 7 items, rated from 0-10 (score range, 0-70) for ability to self-monitor for signs and symptoms of AF. Higher scores reflect more knowledge and more accurate beliefs and positive attitudes toward self-monitoring.","timeFrame":"5 months"},{"measure":"Number of cases of atrial fibrillation detected with portable ECG","description":"The Alive Cor portable ECG recorder will be used to detect atrial fibrillation.
