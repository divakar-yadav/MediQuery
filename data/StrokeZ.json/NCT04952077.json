However, their spatiotemporal evolution in the suites of reperfusion is unclear.\n\nClose monitoring by MRI would make it possible to precisely know the tissue, vascular and microvascular evolution of the infarct area and the penumbra after reperfusion, and thus to characterize MRI biomarkers associated with efficient tissue reperfusion.\n\nThe aim of the MR-Reperfusion study is to characterize new MRI biomarkers of efficient tissue reperfusion."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke, Acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: MRI"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"MRI","description":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)","armGroupLabels":["Experimental"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Description of MRI biomarkers (volume, location of the infarction and penumbra;
