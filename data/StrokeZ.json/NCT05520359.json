Research with humans and animals have highlighted the critical importance of both motor and sensory pathways for motor learning after neurologic injury. However, the best techniques for engaging motor and sensory pathways in a way that brings high quality mobility are not well understood. With this study we will examinee how increased sensory feedback, through mobility device use and electrical spinal stimulation, impact movement mechanics in people with neurological conditions to inform long-term studies and eventual implementation into clinical practice.\n\nMobility devices offer a promising approach to improve mobility rehabilitation through engagement of sensory and motor pathways. These devices can either assist in movement by providing support to perform an activity or they can be used to provide resistance to build strength. Mechanistically how these devices impact movement mechanics is still not well understood.\n\nElectrical spinal stimulation with intensive, repetitive training has demonstrated exciting potential to improve limb function after neurologic injury. Spinal stimulation has shown to improve motor function with long-term training. Stimulation is hypothesized to improve motor pathways through boosting sensory input. However, the neuromechanical effects of stimulation as a result of increased sensory feedback over an acute time frame has not been explored in efforts to test this hypothesis.\n\nThis study aims to evaluate the acute effects of increased afferent feedback in individuals with neurological conditions via mobility devices and spinal stimulation. Understanding how these approaches affect the quantity and quality of movement in the short term is a first step before determining potential treatment outcomes. In this research, we will quantify the neuromechanics of movement with and without these approaches for individuals with neurologic disorders."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Palsy","Stroke","Premature Birth","Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy","Periventricular Leukomalacia"],"keywords":["Pediatric","Mobility Aids","Assistive Technology","Spinal Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized order of visits with individual and combined effects of mobility devices and spinal stimulation.","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Neurologic Disorders","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Evaluation of individual and combined effects of mobility devices and spinal stimulation for individuals with neurologic disorders.","interventionNames":["Device: Mobility Device","Device: Spinal Stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Mobility Device","description":"Use of mobility device during session.","armGroupLabels":["Neurologic Disorders"],"otherNames":["Biomotum SPARK","Trexo","Portable Mobility Aid for Children (PUMA, ENLITEN)"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Spinal Stimulation","description":"A stimulator will be used non-invasively stimulate the spine at the neck and/or lower back (cervical and/or lum","armGroupLabels":["Neurologic Disorders"],"otherNames":["SpineX"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Muscle Coordination","description":"Change in level of co-contraction between the plantarflexor and tibialis anterior muscles during the gait cycle monitored from electromyography recordings.","timeFrame":"Comparing first and last minute of walking on treadmill at each experimental session."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Modified Ashworth Scale","description":"Change in summed score of spasticity from lower-extremity muscles.
