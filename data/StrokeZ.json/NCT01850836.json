Each patient received 1000 rTMS pulses (1 Hertz at 110% of resting motor threshold) over the unaffected Broca's area and 1000 pulses (20 Hertz at 100% resting motor threshold) over affected left Broca's area for 10 consecutive days. LANGUAGE section of hemispheric stroke scale, Stroke Aphasic Depression Questionnaire Hospital Version (SADQ-H) and NIH stroke scale were assessed before, post sessions, 1 and 2 months after the last session . Motor threshold was assessed before and after the end of last session."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Fluent Aphasia in Subacute Stroke"],"keywords":["Aphasia, Stroke, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation."]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":29,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Real rTMS","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"19 subacute stroke pts with aphasia received 10 rTMS (5sessions/week) for 2 successive weeks","interventionNames":["Procedure: repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation"]},{"label":"Sham rTMS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"10 patients received sham rTMS stimulation (5 sessions/week) for 2 successive weeks","interventionNames":["Procedure: repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation","armGroupLabels":["Real rTMS","Sham rTMS"],"otherNames":["rTMS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Hemispheric stroke scale (HSS)","description":"Language assessment using hemispheric stroke scale (HSS)","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline in HSS at 2 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS)","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline in NIHSS at 2 months"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke Aphasic Depression Questionnaire Hospital Version (SADQ-H)","description":"(Asking about presence of depressive symptoms within last week of stroke to be present all the days or frequent from 4-6 days, or infrequent from 1-4 days, or not at all).","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline in SADQ-H at 2 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* acute hemiplegia with non-fluent aphasia, single thromboembolic non-haemorrhagic infarction documented by computerized tomography (CT) in the distribution of middle cerebral artery.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* head injury or neurological disease other than stroke,\n* Unstable cardiac dysrhythmia,\n* Fever,\n* Infection,\n* Hyperglycaemia\n* Prior administration of tranquilizer\n* Patients with no motor evoked response recorded from first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle of the affected hand","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000001037","term":"Aphasia"},{"id":"D000001039","term":"Aphasia, Broca"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000013064","term":"Speech Disorders"},{"id":"D000007806","term":"Language Disorders"},{"id":"D000003147","term":"Communication Disorders"},{"id":"D000019954","term":"Neurobehavioral Manifestations"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4042","name":"Aphasia","asFound":"Aphasia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4043","name":"Aphasia, Broca","asFound":"Non-fluent Aphasia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M15554","name":"Speech Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10513","name":"Language Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6064","name":"Communication Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21516","name":"Neurobehavioral Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]}},"hasResults":false}
