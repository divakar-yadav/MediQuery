Patients are randomized 1 : 1 to either non-intubated state or to intubated state for endovascular stroke treatment. Otherwise, no principal differences in intensive care treatment are intended, and standard operating procedures are applied to ensure uniform management decisions in fields such as ventilation, sedation, cardio-vascular and cerebral monitoring and management.","detailedDescription":"Early recanalization is an important, if not the most important, factor concerning reconstitution of patients´ health in ischaemic stroke. This is the reason why patients with extended stroke are increasingly subjected to an endovascular stroke therapy (EST).\n\nMatter of ongoing debate is how to sedate these patients during intervention. Some clinicians prefer an intubation due to a reduction of patients´movements and therefore potentially lowering complication rates (injury by catheter, aspiration e.g.).\n\nOn the other hand retrospective investigations hypothesize that general anaesthesia is associated with peri-interventional hypotension followed by poorer clinical outcome.\n\nThe best anaesthaesiologic management in endovascular stroke therapy to this point of time is not known. The investigators therefore designed this study comparing intubated state with general anaesthesia vs. non-intubated state with conscious sedation during EST, focusing on patients´ outcome."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Ischemic Stroke"],"keywords":["ischemic stroke","recanalisation","sedation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intubation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation + endovascular recanalisation","interventionNames":["Procedure: Endovascular recanalisation"]},{"label":"No Intubation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Conscious sedation and non-invasive ventilatory support + endovascular recanalisation","interventionNames":["Procedure: Endovascular recanalisation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Endovascular recanalisation","description":"Endovascular recanalisation by mechanical thrombectomy with e.g. stent retriever device, possibly following intravenous thrombolysis within a \"bridging concept\"","armGroupLabels":["Intubation","No Intubation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) after 24 hours","description":"Neurological improvement of NIHSS 24 hours after intervention","timeFrame":"24 hours"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Outcome after 3 month using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS)","description":"Assessing the neurological outcome after 3 months with the mRS.","timeFrame":"3 month"},{"measure":"Inpatient-mortality","timeFrame":"Mortality-rate until timepoint of discharge, an expected average of 3 weeks."},{"measure":"Mortality-rate within the first 3 months after intervention.","timeFrame":"First 3 months after intervention"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Duration of hospital stay","timeFrame":"Participants will be followed until timepoint of discharge, an expected average of 3 weeks."},{"measure":"Periinterventional complications","timeFrame":"Evaluation of Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability until timepoint of discharge, an expected average of 3 weeks."},{"measure":"Achieved recanalisation grade","description":"Recanalisation status is classified according to the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction classification (TICI).","timeFrame":"Duration of intervention with an expected average of 2 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* age ≥18 years\n* acute stroke in anterior circulation\n* occlusion of carotid artery and/ or middle cerebral artery\n* planned mechanical recanalisation\n* informed consent from patient or legal representative\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* age \\< 18 years\n* informed consent not obtainable\n* coma\n* agitation\n* vomiting\n* difficult airway management\n* additional cerebral hemorrhage","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Julian Bösel, PD","affiliation":"Department of Neurology, University Hospital Heidelberg","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Department of Neurology, University Hospital Heidelberg","city":"Heidelberg","state":"Baden-Württemberg","zip":"69120","country":"Germany","geoPoint":{"lat":49.40768,"lon":8.69079}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"20472172","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Lees KR, Bluhmki E, von Kummer R, Brott TG, Toni D, Grotta JC, Albers GW, Kaste M, Marler JR, Hamilton SA, Tilley BC, Davis SM, Donnan GA, Hacke W; ECASS, ATLANTIS, NINDS and EPITHET rt-PA Study Group; Allen K, Mau J, Meier D, del Zoppo G, De Silva DA, Butcher KS, Parsons MW, Barber PA, Levi C, Bladin C, Byrnes G.
