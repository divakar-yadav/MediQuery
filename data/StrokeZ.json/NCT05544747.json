In the last few years, several approaches have been used for the recovery of hand dexterity after stroke. Among them, the Mirror therapy, task-oriented therapy, robot-assisted rehabilitation and action observation has gained greatest attention.Action observation training is one of the new developing rehabilitation technique that targets motor learning by the activation of mirror neurons and is the most important approach that targets the motor and functional recovery in stroke patients. In action observation training, the movements are produced because of the external stimuli in which actually the visual attention recruit the cerebellar-thalamic-cortical circuit of the brain. Action observation is based on activities of the motor neuron system and they discharge mostly in association with complex tasks as compared to simple tasks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Action Observation Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The patients in the action observation therapy group will be required to observe the upper limb movements or functional actions in video clips.

Before starting the test an extra 15 seconds time is given to the patient for familiarization with the test.
