'Small vessel disease' also affects the brain diffusely, causing up to 40% of dementias, alone or mixed with Alzheimer's disease, 350,000+ patients estimated currently in the United Kingdom. There is no proven treatment: conventional antiplatelet drugs may be ineffective or even hazardous, antihypertensive treatment and statins have been disappointing. The disease mechanism is poorly understood but endothelial dysfunction, blood-brain barrier failure and vessel stiffness appear to contribute to the pathogenesis. Promising data available for licensed drugs with relevant modes of action, cilostazol (\\>6000 stroke patients in the Asia Pacific region) and isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN, widely used in cardiac disease) support their testing in small vessel disease. This trial will be a phase 2, randomised, dose-escalation, factorial trial to test short-term administration of cilostazol, Isosorbide Mononitrate, both, or neither, to provide data on patient tolerability of dose (including headache, dizziness), safety (including blood pressure, platelet function), provide mechanistic evidence of efficacy (cerebrovascular reactivity, arterial compliance), and to inform the design of a larger phase 2-3 trial. The trial will recruit 60 patients with small vessel disease, in two expert stroke centres (Edinburgh and Nottingham) where there are suitable patients, expert stroke centres, established trials infrastructures and neuroimaging and platelet testing expertise. The trial will also advance methods to stratify patients by small vessel disease burden in routine practise and data on intermediary mechanistic outcomes to assist in planning future trials testing novel agents for either stroke or dementia."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases","Cognitive Impairment","Stroke"],"keywords":["cerebral small vessel disease","cerebrovascular reactivity","cilostazol","isosorbide mononitrate"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":57,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group 1","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Isosorbide mononitrate 25mg bd","interventionNames":["Drug: isosorbide mononitrate"]},{"label":"Group 2","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Cilostazol 100mg bd","interventionNames":["Drug: cilostazol"]},{"label":"Group 3","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Isosorbide mononitrate 25mg bd and cilostazol 100mg bd start immediately","interventionNames":["Drug: isosorbide mononitrate","Drug: cilostazol"]},{"label":"Group 4","type":"OTHER","description":"Isosorbide mononitrate 25mg bd and cilostazol 100mg bd delayed start","interventionNames":["Drug: isosorbide mononitrate","Drug: cilostazol"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"isosorbide mononitrate","description":"slow release nitric oxide donor that enhances vasodilation and widely used in angina prophyaxis","armGroupLabels":["Group 1","Group 3","Group 4"],"otherNames":["Isotard"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"cilostazol","description":"phosphodiesterase 3-inhibitor that enhances vessel wall function with weak antiplatelet effects","armGroupLabels":["Group 2","Group 3","Group 4"],"otherNames":["pletal"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Tolerability proportion of patients able to tolerate the target dose","description":"proportion of patients able to tolerate the target dose","timeFrame":"8 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Safety -
