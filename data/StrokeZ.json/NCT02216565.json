The efficiency of the strategies will be assessed in terms of early neurological clinical recovery.\n\nThe study will focus on three particular situations : (1) tandem internal carotid and middle cerebral artery occlusion, (2) situations where patient cannot benefit from fibrinolysis because of high risk of haemorrhage, (3) situations where fibrinolysis is not recommended because of a delay superior to 4.5 hours.\n\nThe hypothesis to be tested is that medical approach plus endovascular treatment is superior to medical treatment alone"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Acute"],"keywords":["Stroke","Endovascular treatment","Tandem carotid occlusions","Fibrinolysis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Medical treatment","type":"OTHER","description":"Conventional medical non-interventional treatment","interventionNames":["Other: Hospitalization in specialized neuro-vascular unit","Drug: Alteplase if patient is eligible","Other: Supportive care"]},{"label":"Endovascular treatment","type":"OTHER","description":"Conventional medical treatment plus endovascular treatment","interventionNames":["Other: Hospitalization in specialized neuro-vascular unit","Drug: Alteplase if patient is eligible","Other: Supportive care","Procedure: Endovascular treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Hospitalization in specialized neuro-vascular unit","armGroupLabels":["Endovascular treatment","Medical treatment"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Alteplase if patient is eligible","description":"Alteplase intravenous thrombolysis performed if patient is eligible (if not contraindicated)","armGroupLabels":["Endovascular treatment","Medical treatment"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Supportive care","description":"Drugs, procedures and techniques aimed at preventing/managing complications or aggravation of the patient's neurological condition","armGroupLabels":["Endovascular treatment","Medical treatment"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Endovascular treatment","description":"Recanalization treatment (thrombectomy / intraarterial thrombolysis)","armGroupLabels":["Endovascular treatment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Improvement in NIHSS score after 24h","description":"Percentage of improvement in the National Institute of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) between baseline (t0) and h24 (t1) calculated as follow :\n\n\\[NIHSS(t0) -
