patients undergoing carotid artery stenting to a performance goal based on an analysis of the results of previous US IDE carotid stenting with embolic protection studies","detailedDescription":"Patient registry procedures include:\n\n* Clinical Events Committee (CEC); responsibility for validating all reported primary safety outcomes\n* Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB); to review and evaluate safety data including serious adverse events\n* 100% data monitoring; to compare data entered into the registry\n* Source data verification; to assess the accuracy, completeness of registry data by comparing the data to external data sources (e.g., medical records, paper or electronic case report forms).\n* Standard Operating Procedures; to address registry operations and analysis activities, such as patient recruitment, data collection, data management, data analysis and reporting for adverse events.\n* Sample size assessment to specify the number of participants and follow up duration.\n* Data Management Plan; to address situations where variables are reported as missing, unavailable, \"non-reported,\" uninterpretable, or considered missing because of data inconsistency or out-of-range results\n* Statistical analysis plan; describing the analytical principles and statistical techniques to be employed in order to address the primary and secondary objectives, as specified in the study protocol or plan."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carotid Artery Diseases","Stroke"],"keywords":["Carotid","Carotid artery
