Although this treatment is effective on muscle tone improvement, its effect on gait and ability of daily living on early stage of stroke adults remains uncertain.The purpose of this study is to determine whether an early calf muscle injection of low dose BoNT-A in severely affected patients within 6 weeks after stroke could help to hold back disabling muscle spasticity and improve walking dysfunction.","detailedDescription":"The high prevalence of stroke is a global problem causing well-known long-term disabilities. Post-stroke lower-extremity spasticity may cause severe functional limitations and pain. Spasticity is a phenomenon defined as disordered sensory-motor control, resulting from upper motor neuron (UMN) lesion, presenting as intermittent or sustained involuntary activation of muscles . Spasticity may interfere with motor function, and is a common reason for clinical interventions such as by physiotherapy, use of orthoses or other technical devices or drugs. Botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) is a potent neurotoxin that is produced by the bacterium clostridium botulinum. BoNT-A, by blocking acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions, accounts for its therapeutic action to relieve dystonia, spasticity, and related disorders.\n\nUnfortunately, intramuscular injections of botulinum often carried out when the patients have obvious spasticity . It is normally given until the clinical signs of an elevated muscle tone have become established; therefore it is usually given at least three months after stroke , . It will impede the rehabilitation of the patients. Accordingly, the present study asked whether an early calf muscle injection of low dose BoNT-A in severely affected patients within 6 weeks after stroke could help to hold back disabling muscle spasticity and improve walking dysfunction along 24 weeks fellow up trail.\n\nThis is a randomized, open-label, controlled trial along 24-weeks trails. Referred sample of adult subacute stroke patients (within 6 weeks since stroke, n=30) with mild spasticity of calf muscle will be included. Patients were randomly allocated to BoNT-A treatment group (15 patients) and control group (15 patients). In BoNT-A treatment group patients received 200 units BoNT-A injection in the triceps surae (150iu) and tibial muscle posterior (50iu). No special treatment was performed in the control group. Both groups received comprehensive rehabilitation for 8 weeks. Lower limbs Fugl-Meyer (FM) score, calf muscle modified Ashworth scale assess (MAS), gastrocnemius surface electromyography (sEMG) evaluation and modified Barthel index (MBI) were assessed before and 8, 12, 24 weeks after treatment. Gait analysis (step length，cadence，speed), 6-min walking distance were assessed 8, 12, 24 weeks after injection."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Muscle Spasticity"],"keywords":["Stroke","Botulinum Toxins","Muscle Spasticity","Gait"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"BoNT-A treatment group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In BoNT-A treatment group patients received 200 units BoNT-A injection in the triceps surae (150iu) and tibial muscle posterior (50iu).
