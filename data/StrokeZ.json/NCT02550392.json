'Minor stroke' is a term used to describe a stroke with mild and nondisabling symptoms. TIA and minor stroke patients account for more than half of all cases of stroke and they are at a higher risk to suffer a major stroke. Currently, management of TIA/minor stroke patients is mainly focused on identifying and reducing risk factors for a later stroke. However, people after a TIA often have limited access for further specialist support from stroke-specific rehabilitation services. Although there is variability in the level of recovery and severity of symptoms after TIA and minor stroke, there is evidence that these patients may experience difficulties that affect their quality of life including anxiety and depression.\n\nThis study aims to develop, tailor and target the delivery of a time-limited group intervention that offers educational, psychological and social support for people following TIA and minor stroke. A qualitative study (Phase 1) will be conducted with service users and experts working with people with TIA/minor stroke to develop the psychoeducational intervention. Following this, we will conduct a feasibility randomised controlled trial in one centre (Phase 2) to explore whether this group psychoeducational intervention for people after TIA and minor stroke carers is acceptable and to determine the feasibility of the proposed evaluation and the sample size needed in a definite trial.","detailedDescription":"Participants will complete measures at baseline and then randomly allocated to receive the intervention or usual care. The intervention group will receive a group psychoeducational intervention (designed in Phase 1: Qualitative study) in addition to self-help leaflets and usual care. It is anticipated that the intervention will be offered in 6 two-hour sessions over 3 months by an assistant psychologist. The control group will receive usual care plus self-help leaflets on relevant topics. All participants will complete outcome measures at 3 and 6 months after randomisation. We will test the feasibility, tolerability and acceptability of delivering the intervention and will record data on study completion and attrition. Findings will inform the development of a larger trial and will determine if the content and delivery of the intervention meets the needs of people after TIA and minor stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Transient Ischaemic Attack","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":64,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group psychoeducation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention group will receive a group psychoeducational intervention (designed in Phase 1: Qualitative study) and usual care.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Psychoeducation"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Participants in the usual care control group will continue to receive all other services routinely available to them as is usual practice."}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Psychoeducation","description":"A time-limited group psychoeducational intervention that will aim to offer educational, psychological and social support.","armGroupLabels":["Group psychoeducation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of participants recruited to the trial","timeFrame":"up to 1 year"},{"measure":"Number of participants who completed the trial","timeFrame":"participants will be followed for the duration of the trial, an expected average of 12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mood","description":"General Health Questionnaire-30 (GHQ-30)","timeFrame":"baseline, 3 and 6 months follow-up"},{"measure":"Health-related Quality of Life","description":"EuroQuol-5D","timeFrame":"baseline, 3 and 6 months follow-up"},{"measure":"Knowledge and Satisfaction","description":"Knowledge and Satisfaction Questionnaire","timeFrame":"baseline, 3 and 6 months follow-up"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion criteria:\n\n* adults with a first/recurrent TIA or minor stroke;\n* identified within 6 months of their diagnosis;\n* who are independent with activities of daily living;\n* who consent to take part\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* diagnosis of dementia;\n* receiving psychological interventions for mental health difficulties immediately prior to their TIA/minor stroke, visual or hearing impairments that would impact on ability to complete baseline assessments;\n* cognitive or communication difficulties that would impact on ability to complete baseline assessments and to participate in group sessions;\n* unable to communicate in English.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Eirini Kontou, PhD DClinPsy","affiliation":"University of Nottingham","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust","city":"Nottingham","country":"United Kingdom","geoPoint":{"lat":52.9536,"lon":-1.15047}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000002546","term":"Ischemic Attack, Transient"},{"id":"D000007511","term":"Ischemia"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D000002545","term":"Brain Ischemia"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10233","name":"Ischemia","asFound":"Ischemic","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5485","name":"Ischemic Attack, Transient","asFound":"Transient Ischemic Attack","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5484","name":"Brain Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
