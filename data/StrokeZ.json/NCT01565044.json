Most conventional rehabilitation techniques are aimed to improve motor intentional movement by repeated exercises. These techniques require attentional load and are responsible for significant fatigue that probably represents a limiting factor. Alternatively, the automatic control of action is now well documented. A rehabilitation method based on this principle could allow recovery of more natural movements.\n\nHypothesis: Stimulating automatic motricity improves upper-limb motor skills compared with a rehabilitation technique based on intentional movements."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Upper-limb Paresis"],"keywords":["Stroke","hemiplegia","automatic pilot","upper-limb rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"\" AUTO \" Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: motor training"]},{"label":"\" CONTROL \" Group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: motor training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"motor training","description":"Subject will perform prehension exercises on an automated table.
