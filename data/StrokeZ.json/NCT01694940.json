Mitochondria are often called the \"powerhouses of the cell\" because they provide the energy our cells need to live. Mitochondria have their own DNA (mtDNA), but they also rely on DNA from the nucleus (nDNA). Mitochondrial diseases are caused by mutations in either mitochondrial or nuclear DNA that result in poorly functioning mitochondria. This can cause a variety of symptoms including muscle weakness, seizures, mental retardation, dementia, hearing loss, blindness, strokes, diabetes, and premature death. Most mitochondrial diseases are progressive, and we are unable to cure most of these diseases with currently available treatments.\n\nResearch into mitochondrial diseases has been hampered by the low frequency of these disorders and by under-diagnosis by clinicians. This has hindered patient recruitment for research studies and clinical trials. The North American Mitochondrial Disease Consortium (NAMDC) was established to help surmount these issues. Led jointly by Drs. Michio Hirano and Salvatore DiMauro, NAMDC is a consortium of several clinicians and researchers with an interest in mitochondrial disease research in the United States and Canada.\n\nBy creating a mechanism for the sharing of patient samples with researchers, data and patient contact information, NAMDC will make it easier to conduct clinical and basic laboratory research.\n\nPatient information will be shared through the use of the \"Patient Data Registry,\" a specially-designed database, and patient tissue samples will be shared through the use of the \"Patient Sample Biorepository\", a storage facility in which patient-derived biological samples will be maintained. The Registry and the Biorepository will hopefully accelerate progress in the understanding and treatment of mitochondrial disease.\n\nPatients can enroll at any of the NAMDC member sites. A web-based remote enrollment is also available at www.namdc.org for eligible patients who reside far from any of the NAMDC participating sites."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Mitochondrial Disorders","Mitochondrial Genetic Disorders","Mitochondrial Diseases","Disorder of Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain Complexes","Deletion and Duplication of Mitochondrial DNA"],"keywords":["mitochondrial disorders","Mito Disease","Mitochondria","Mitochondrial disease","Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke (MELAS) Syndrome","Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers (MERRF)","Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)","Leigh Syndrome","Neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP)","Kearns Sayre syndrome","Alpers Huttenlocher","Pearson","Mitochondrial Neurogastrointestinal Encephalopathy (MNGIE)","Barth Syndrome","Coenzyme Q (CoQ) Deficiency","Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)","DAD","Diabetes and Deafness","Encephalopathy","Encephalomyopathy","Familial Bilateral Striatal Necrosis (FBSN)","Hepatocerebral Disease","Leukoencephalopathy","Maternally Inherited Leigh Syndrome (MILS)","Complex I Deficiency","Complex II Deficiency","Complex III Deficiency","Complex IV Deficiency","Complex V Deficiency","mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome","mtDNA depletion syndrome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Any type of tissue sample can be stored in the biorepository."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Mitochondrial Disease Patients","description":"Patients with possible or known mitochondrial disorders.
