Repetitive peripheral electrical stimulation (RPES) is a novel strategy to improve upper limb motor performance in the post-stroke chronic phase but its effects in the subacute phase are still poorly understood. The objectives of this study are to compare the effects of RPES on motor performance of the upper limb in the subacute and chronic phases of stroke, and to identify the mechanisms underlying this intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Neuromodulation","Peripheral stimulation","Motor function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","maskingDescription":"An amendment for performance of a minimization procedure in order to enhance the probability of comparable characteristics between the groups was approved.
