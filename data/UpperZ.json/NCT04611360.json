Around the globe stroke is the chief cause of incapacity and passing.\n\nThe trans-cranial direct current stimulations (tDCS) could be a non-invasive,low cost and capable brain stimulator utilised within the treatment of brain disorders.Two modes of tDCS is utilised is stroke patients,anodal stimulation (increased in excitability) of the lesional half of the globe and cathodal stimulation (decreased in excitability) of the contralesional hemisphere. The transcranial direct current stimulation induced polarity-dependent changes in membrane excitability, with Anodal-tDCS causing depolarisation and cathodal-tDCS causing hyper polarization of membrane potential in neurons of the stimulated area.\n\nThe role of Trans-cranial Direct Current Stimulation as a catalyst of recovery in stroke population and found that it's a safe,portable,non invasive brain stimulation technique. T-DCS is able to modulate the excitability of specified brain areas by varying the neuronal membrane potentials that based on the polarity of the current transmitted through the scalp via sponge electrodes. Trans-cranial direct current stimulation is clinically potential for use in stroke recovery because of its ease of use, non invasive-ness and safety."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Balance","Stroke","Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Conventional training exercises","interventionNames":["Other: Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Group"]},{"label":"Conventional Training Exercises Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Conventional Training Exercises : Bridging,Sitting: weight-bearing, Standing: weight-bearing, Sit to stand, Squat exercises and Tandem walk","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional Training Exercises Group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Group","description":"Experimental group were received anodal transcranial direct current stimulation and conventional training exercises for 3 days a weeks for 6 consecutive weeks on alternate days.\n\nAnodal tDCS were given through:\n\ni.
