Other objectives include assessing the required doses of electrical current amplitudes, the usability of the device, and examining the overall safety.\n\nMany individuals experience weakness or paralysis of their arms and hands following a stroke. As a result, they are often unable to grasp and reach objects voluntarily and have difficulty performing basic activities of daily living (ADLs) such as dressing, feeding, bathing and grooming. Despite extensive rehabilitation programs, many of these individuals remain dependent on others for assistance with ADLs. This unmet medical need remains the focus of a wide range of research efforts.\n\nMyndMove is a newly developed Functional Electrical Stimulation based treatment designed to recover voluntary movement in severely paralyzed upper limbs following stroke and spinal cord injury.\n\nThis study will enroll stroke patients that have severe hemiparesis of an upper limb (as defined by 1) an UE-FMA score of less than or equal to 19 and 2) a Chedoke McMaster Stage of 1-2 for the arm and hand). Three cohorts of patients enrolled in the study will include:\n\n* Early sub-acute stroke patients (less than 2 months post stroke) receiving therapy during inpatient rehabilitation;\n* Late sub-acute stroke patients (post-discharge from inpatient rehab and less than 6 months post stroke) receiving therapy in outpatient clinic settings; and\n* Chronic stroke patients (greater than 6 months post stroke) receiving therapy in outpatient clinic settings"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular accident","Upper extremity","Cerebral Infarction","Brain Infarction","Brain Ischemia","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Cardiovascular Diseases","Nervous System Diseases","Central Nervous System Diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":75,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MyndMove","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The MyndMove system is a neuromodulation device that delivers short electrical pulses to stimulate muscle contractions and enhance motor recovery following Stroke or Spinal Cord Injury. MyndMove delivers therapeutic stimulation sequences called protocols, which are coded therapeutic algorithms which assist muscle movement allowing the brain and central nervous system to be retrained restoring voluntary reaching and grasping functions lost following neurological injury.

As the patient is attempting to perform the designated task, specific muscles in the arm are stimulated to generate contractions that produce the desired movement. After a brief interval of the patient attempting to initiate a movement the therapist activates the MyndMove stimulation protocol, which generates bursts of short electrical pulses, using surface electrodes, to produce muscle contractions enabling the patient to complete the desired/instructed task. Proper sequencing of the muscle contractions as per the MyndMove protocols are tailored to achieve a wide range of reaching and grasping functions. The technique stimulates non-damaged pathways of the central nervous system.","armGroupLabels":["MyndMove"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment (UE-FMA)","description":"The Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment (UE-FMA) is a standardized scale used for the evaluation of physical performance in the post-stroke hemiplegic patient.

The maximum score associated with the UE-FMA is 66 points. Each of the 33 specific tasks is scored as either 0 or an absence of function to a maximum score of 2 for the tasks being fully completed.

The FIM consists of 18 items of which 13 are motor related tasks and 5 are cognitive related items. The measure is broken down into 6 classifications of self-care, sphincter control, mobility, locomotion, communication and social cognition. The self-care consists of 6 items: eating, grooming, bathing, dressing-upper body, dressing-lower body, toileting.
