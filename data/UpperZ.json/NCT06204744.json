The main questions it aims to answer is:\n\nâ€¢ the efficacy of the home-based GRASP program relative to the conventional occupational therapy intervention on improving health outcomes, including UE motor function, daily function, quality of life, and motor control strategies.\n\nStroke participants will be randomly assigned to either the Home-based GRASP group or the conventional occupational therapy home program group. Each group will undergo an 4 to 6-week intervention (3 sessions/week) with evaluations conducted before, immediately after, and 3 months post-trial, assessing clinical and kinematic measures. Interviews and surveys will be conducted to gain insights into the perspectives of patients regarding the implementation of the home-based GRASP program."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":143,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Home-based GRASP program","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Home-based GRASP program"]},{"label":"Conventional occupational therapy home program","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional occupational therapy home program"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Home-based GRASP program","description":"The home-based Graded Repetitive Arm Supplementary Program (GRASP) is designed to improve the upper extremity function for people with stroke, including exercises for stretching, coordination, arm and hand strengthening, and fine motor skills.","armGroupLabels":["Home-based GRASP program"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional occupational therapy home program","description":"The conventional OT home program will be prescribed by the occupational therapists, customizing stroke rehabilitation exercises to individual patient goals, with a primary focus on improving upper extremity function.","armGroupLabels":["Conventional occupational therapy home program"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl Meyer Assessment (upper extremity)","description":"The FMA-UE is one of the most widely used assessments to quantify UE sensorimotor impairment of the shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand.
