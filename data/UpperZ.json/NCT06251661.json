The main question is:\n\nâ€¢ Does cognitive multi-sensory rehabilitation significantly affect upper limb function and fatigue in stroke patients? Participants will be assigned into two groups. They will receive 12 sessions of study group CMR and traditional physical therapy and control group traditional physical Therapy rehabilitation. CMR 40 minutes immediately followed by 20 minutes of selected physical therapy program, three sessions per week for four weeks.","detailedDescription":"About 70% of people with stroke are unable to use their affected hand efficiently in activities of daily living. Further, post-stroke fatigue affects up to 92% of post-stroke patients. Post-stroke fatigue is a multifaceted motor and cognitive process, in which the patient experiences tiredness and lack of energy that develops during physical or mental activity which may persist for years. Post-stroke fatigue impacts the mental/physical functions of the patient through decreased energy, and thus, is a significant barrier to recovery.\n\nPreliminary evidence indicates sensory rehabilitation may enhance motor recovery in people with stroke. Cognitive Multisensory Rehabilitation (CMR) is a therapist-guided sensorimotor rehabilitation approach, that targets the patients' ability to solve sensory discrimination exercises, where the patient compares the sensations felt by the hand to the shapes observed with the eyes. Cognitive processes are encouraged by asking the patient to determine the limb movement or its position, how the movement was felt in the body, how the limb moved in relation to other parts of the body, and to spatial parameters in the environment. Because CMR integrates cognitive processes with sensory and motor tasks, it may be a novel method to address post-stroke fatigue, and it may increase connectivity in sensory and motor areas of the brain."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["CMR, Stroke, upper limb function, fatigue"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group 1 (GA)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"20 Egyptian ischemic stroke patients receive 12 sessions of CMR and traditional physical therapy each session lasts for 40 minutes of CMR and 30 minutes of traditional physical therapy.","interventionNames":["Other: Cognitive multi-sensory Rehabilition","Other: selected traditional physical therapy program."]},{"label":"Group 2 (GB)","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"20 Egyptian ischemic stroke patients receive 12 sessions of traditional physical therapy each session lasts for 30 minutes.","interventionNames":["Other: selected traditional physical therapy program."]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Cognitive multi-sensory Rehabilition","description":"Kinetic awareness: Initially, only one joint will be moved at a time.
