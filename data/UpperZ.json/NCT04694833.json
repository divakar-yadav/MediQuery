These impairments limit activity, restrict participation and affect quality of life. Therefore, rehabilitation programs are provided from the earliest days. However, an important proportion of patients do not achieve the recommended amount of rehabilitation therapy (even in institutional systems). In fact, patients do not always have access to healthcare systems. Moreover, hospital resources and healthcare systems are often limited (especially in poor countries) which has led to the development of new cost-effective rehabilitation methods such as self-rehabilitation and tele-rehabilitation.\n\nThis study aims :\n\n1. to develop and validate relevant self-assessments tools in virtual reality\n2. to propose auto-adaptative virtual reality-based therapies based on the link between motor and cognitive functions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis","Cognitive Impairment","Healthy Subjects"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Studies will be conducted in a single group of (a) stroke patients and (b) healthy subjects","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":400,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Stroke patients with hemiparesis and/or cognitive impairments (such as apraxia, aphasia and hemineglect)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Motor and cognitive virtual reality-based assessments","Behavioral: Motor and cognitive virtual reality-based serious games"]},{"label":"Healthy subjects","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects who do not suffer from any pathology that could affect upper-limb motor function or cognition","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Motor and cognitive virtual reality-based assessments","Behavioral: Motor and cognitive virtual reality-based serious games"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Motor and cognitive virtual reality-based assessments","description":"Motor and cognitive testing in virtual reality","armGroupLabels":["Healthy subjects","Stroke patients"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Motor and cognitive virtual reality-based serious games","description":"Serious games implemented in virtual reality to rehabilitate motor and cognitive impairments.","armGroupLabels":["Healthy subjects","Stroke patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment","description":"Highly recommended scale that assess upper limb motor function (0% = worse outcome; 100% best outcome).","timeFrame":"Through study completion, on average 24 weeks"},{"measure":"Box and Block Test","description":"A measure of manual dexterity and activity that requires repeatedly moving 1-inch blocks from one side of a box to another in 60 seconds.","timeFrame":"Through study completion, on average 24 weeks"},{"measure":"The Bells Test","description":"A cancellation task, permits a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of visual neglect","timeFrame":"Through study completion, on average 24 weeks"},{"measure":"Action Research Arm Test","description":"A 19 item observational measure used by physical therapists and other health care professionals to assess upper extremity performance (coordination, dexterity and functioning).
