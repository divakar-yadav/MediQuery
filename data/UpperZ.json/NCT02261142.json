A method for treating spasticity that applies low-amplitude electrical stimulation through a garment with built-in electrodes, Mollii® (Elektrodress), has been developed. The garment is to be used in combination with individualized training and the stimulation is mainly given to antagonists of spastic muscles.\n\nThe general objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of and costs associated with the Mollii® treatment of spasticity due to stroke or cerebral palsy.\n\nPrimary objectives are;\n\n* to study whether treatment with the Mollii® improves function and activity\n* to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the treatment, from both a health-care perspective and a societal perspective.\n\nSecondary objectives are;\n\n* to study whether there are differences in treatment effect between the stroke and the Cerebral Palsy groups in a subgroup-analysis\n* to assess compliance with treatment\n* to report any adverse effects.","detailedDescription":"This study is designed as a double-blinded, randomized, cross-over trial (RCT). This part of the study takes 12 weeks (6 weeks of active treatment and 6 weeks of non-active treatment) and is followed by a wash-out period of 6 weeks. An uncontrolled,open phase starts after week 18, where patients are followed one year after inclusion.\n\n30 participants with spasticity due to Stroke and Cerebral Palsy will be included.\n\nTwo centers are recruiting participants and are collecting data.\n\nOutcome measures are chosen to reflect the different dimensions in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and patient reported outcome measures (PROM)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spasticity","Stroke","Cerebral Palsy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":31,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Multifocal TENS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Multifocal TENS given in the garment Mollii® (Elektrodress) 1 hour every second day together with individualized training exercises.
