In this method, the participant is told about the desired movement and is asked to do so. Then the participant is asked to imagine as if he was watching the movement without making any movement. It is scored between 1-5 points. 1: no image, 5: as clear as the original. At the other stage, he is asked to imagine himself by feeling what he is doing and is scored between 1 and 5 points. 1 point: no sense, 5 points mean intense feeling as if he is making the move. The scale assesses both visual and kinesthetic imagery with each dimension being scored from 5 to 25 with higher scores indicating greater imagery clarity or intensity.","timeFrame":"6 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosed as stroke patient.\n* Speaks, reads and writes in Turkish.\n* Hand functions at 4, 5, 6 levels according to Brunnstrom.\n* Mini mental test score to be at least 24.\n* Volunteer for participation.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Neurological, orthopedic problems other than stroke.\n* To have motion sickness that cannot continue 3D application.\n* Individuals neglecting the affected side","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Şebnem AVCI, Ph.D","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+905057811059","email":"avciseb@hotmail.com"},{"name":"Ramazan KURUL, Ph.D","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+905436414731","email":"ramazankurul2@hotmail.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Mustafa Fatih Yaşar, MD","affiliation":"Bolu Abant Izzet Baylsa University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Ramazan KURUL, Ph.D","affiliation":"Bolu Abant Izzet Baylsa University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Muhammed Nur Ögün, MD","affiliation":"Bolu Abant Izzet Baylsa University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Şebnem AVCI, Ph.D","affiliation":"Bolu Abant Izzet Baylsa University","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Abant Izzet Baysal University","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Bolu","state":"Merkez","zip":"14100","country":"Turkey","contacts":[{"name":"Muhammed Nur ÖĞÜN, M.D","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+905072329466","email":"dr.mogun@gmail.com"},{"name":"Ramazan Kurul, Ph.D","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+905436414731","email":"ramazankurul2@hotmail.com"},{"name":"Ramazan Kurul, Ph.D","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Muhammed Nur Öğün, M.D.","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Şebnem Avcı, Ph.D","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":40.73583,"lon":31.60611}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
