This randomized controlled trial is the first study to explore the benefits of combined robotic-assisted therapy and mirror priming strategy in stroke patients. This proposed combined approach might be a novel combination of enhancing movement performance, daily function and quality of life for patients with stroke.","detailedDescription":"Approximately 70% to 80 % of stroke patients suffered from upper limb (UE) hemiparesis which limited their daily function and quality of life, as well as required considerable demands of long-term medical care. Robot-assisted training and mirror priming has been advocated as part of contemporary approaches. The robotic-assisted therapy mainly emphasized on the proximal part of UE, such as shoulder and elbow movement. While mirror priming strategy has been increasingly employed in the UE training, one question has been raised: the affected UE of stroke patients cannot complete the same movement as the sounded limb synchronously. This project will employ the robot-assisted system to assist patients to perform the grasping and releasing movement of both hands simultaneously while mirror priming strategy is applied, and, then, perform intensive and game-based finger movement training with the robotic assistance. This randomized controlled trial is the first study to explore the benefits of combined robotic-assisted therapy and mirror priming strategy in stroke patients. This proposed combined approach might be a novel combination of enhancing movement performance, daily function and quality of life for patients with stroke. This project will further explore the possible neuro-muscular mechanism underlying this combined mirror priming with robotic training. This project attempts to compare the cortical activation and neuromuscular control of patients with stroke and age-matched healthy adults in terms of electroencephalography (EEG) and muscle tone measurement. The findings of this study may lay an evidence-based foundation for bridging basic science and clinical application."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Robot assisted therapy","mirror priming","upper limb","neuromuscular mechanism"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robotic training with mirror therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive 18 intervention sessions for about 6 consecutive weeks in a clinical setting (1 hour per session, 3 sessions per week).
