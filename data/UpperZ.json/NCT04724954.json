It will develop a new longitudinal therapy for elderly stroke survivors who are inpatients and then outpatients at a regional rehabilitation hospital, by adding BAC training to customary care for both inpatients and outpatients. Two systems will be used, improving continuity of care (one each for inpatient and outpatient settings).","detailedDescription":"This study targets participants, who had suffered a stroke very recently, who may or may not have been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairments or dementia (including Alzheimer's disease). It is important to find out if these improvements can be obtained with the computer game-based integrative (motor-cognitive) bimanual rehabilitation developed by Bright Cloud International Corp, and if these gains transfer to daily activities. The study also aims at determining benefit of continuum care training on the BAC in addition to conventional rehabilitation for participants who are inpatients and then outpatients at a rehabilitation hospital and clinic.\n\nSpecific aims are:\n\nBAC technology acceptance (all groups); improved motor function for upper extremity; strengthening shoulder and fingers increased range of motion for arms and fingers; improved independence in activities of daily living; improved cognition; improved emotive state; reduction in perceived upper body pain.\n\nAnother component of the research project is a small pilot targeting individuals with Parkinson's disease. For them the project is going to:\n\ndetermine technology acceptance when using the BrightBrainer system; benefit to arms motor function and strengthening when playing BCI therapeutic games; benefit to reduction or tremor when playing games; cognitive benefits improvement in their well-being."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["acute stroke","sub-acute stage"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Number of subjects: The Investigators expect to enroll up to 40 subjects, inpatients and then outpatients at a research hospital and its outpatient clinic at Kessler Foundation: 20 stroke patients, and 20 will be their spouses/caregivers of subjects participating in the randomized control trials component of this study.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Rehabilitation Therapy on Experimental Robotic Table and standard of care","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"10 elderly 5 days or more post-CVA admitted to Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation/Kessler Foundation) for inpatient rehabilitation will be recruited for experimental group.\n\nThe investigators will also recruit the 10 caregivers of the experimental subjects.
