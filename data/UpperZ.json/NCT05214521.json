Brain stroke (BS) is one of the main causes of upper limb (UL) dysfunction and limitations of daily human activity.The fine use of the hand imparement is often combined with speech, cognitive and emotional disturbances, which is due to the anatomical proximity and close functional relationships of the corresponding areas in the cerebral cortex.\n\nThe objective of the present study will be to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the digital interactive technology (DIT) with artificial intelligence and biofeedback Smart glove \"SensoRehab\" (SGSR) for restoration of in-hand manipulation in patients with ischemic stroke in the early and late recovery period.The SGSR technique involves neurosensory training and retraining to improve the fine use of the hand and arm, and the patient's cognitive and emotional state.\n\n30 patients will be include to the study. After a basic assessment of hand motor function and game training, each patient undergoes sessions on the SGSR system. The program for BS patients includes 10 sessions with the SGSR (15-30 minutes once a day for the affected hand, 2 weeks).\n\nThe clinical outcomes will be obtained at the completion of treatment (2 weeks) and at 1 month after ompletion of the course of rehabilitation. The statistical analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principles.\n\nThe outcomes of interest are motor function state of the UL, pain intensity, cognitive functions, general physical and emotional status. An integral indicators are the assessment of the patient's quality of life and independence in everyday life activity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["post-stroke dysfunction of the hand","upper limb medical rehabilitation","digital interactive technology","artificial intelligence","ischemic stroke rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"an open-label observational trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"digital interactive technology Smart glove \"SensoRehab\"","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The operation of the digital interactive complex Smart glove \"SensoRehab\" is based on the visual and kinesthetic (proprioceptive) biofeedback principle by using a set of cognitive interactive computer games controlled by finger and hand movements.
