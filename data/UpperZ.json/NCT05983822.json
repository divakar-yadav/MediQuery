Stroke is the leading cause of disability worldwide, with a significant individual, family and economic impact. After a stroke event, however, a large percentage of affected patients have a deficit of the hand and, six months after the acute event, 65% of patients with a deficit of the hand are unable to use and integrate the affected hand in activities of daily living, significantly reducing its quality. The impairment of strength, grip and general hand function makes it difficult to perform ADLs and affects the independence of functional activities, making the recovery of hand function an extremely challenging field in stroke rehabilitation.","detailedDescription":"Rehabilitation of the hand in stroke patients has changed substantially over the last decades, with an increasing interest in the use of robotic devices for the treatment of the upper limb. Indeed, the use of such systems makes it possible to increase the amount and intensity of therapy, to standardise treatment, to provide complex but controlled multisensory stimulation, and to support the patient while performing various tasks, preventing inappropriate movements. Moreover, through robotic systems it is possible to acquire kinematic and kinetic data that are processed to obtain quantitative indices in order to objectively evaluate the patient's motor performance before and after the rehabilitation treatment.\n\nAmadeo® (Tyromotion, Austria) is an end-effector type robotic device, specifically designed for hand treatment, effective in reducing hand disability in stroke patients.\n\nThe aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of robotic rehabilitation with an Amadeo® hand end-effector robot (Tyromotion, Austria):\n\n(i) in terms of improved hand function (assessed by clinical and instrumental scales); (ii) on fatigue and quality of life. 24 patients will be recruited at the UOS Post-Acute Rehabilitation, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS, Rome. Patients will be divided into two groups by randomization: one group (experimental group, GA) will perform specific rehabilitation for balance disorders using the end-effector robot Amadeo® (Tyromotion, Austria) 3 times a week, for 4 weeks (12 total sessions), for 45 minutes of treatment, in addition to the conventional treatment, and one group will perform only the conventional treatment (conventional group, GC), as a daily routine, as described below."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Spasticity as Sequela of Stroke","Upper Limb"],"keywords":["Stroke","Robotic rehabilitation","Upper limb"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental Group (GA)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The experimental group (GA) will perform specific rehabilitation for the recovery of hand function using the end-effector robot Amadeo® (Tyromotion, Austria) 3 times a week, for 4 weeks (12 total sessions), for 45 minutes of treatment in addition to conventional treatment.

However, patients with visual or upper extremity impairments may need to have the MFIS administered as an interview. Interviewers should be trained in basic interviewing skills and in the use of this instrument.\n\nThe total score for the MFIS is the sum of the scores for the 21 items.
