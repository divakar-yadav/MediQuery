However, the effectiveness of medicines is moderate and there are several side effects. In this clinical trial, we would like to enhance the protein levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor in the brain by the transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS). By this technology, the symptoms of ICH could be alleviated and the side effects of medicines might be avoided. Preclinical trials have also shown that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound can alleviate the degree of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and significantly improve motor and cognitive deficits after brain injury. The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of TUS for the treatment of patients with hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage. The primary safety assessment indexes are brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). The secondary safety assessment indexes include weight, vital signs, electrocardiogram, general blood biochemical tests, adverse reaction events, and concurrent drug tracking. The feasibility assessment includes blood specific biomarker expression and neurological function \\& quality of life scales."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracerebral Hemorrhage","Hemiplegia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Transcranial ultrasound stimulation and rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The investigators expect to enroll 10 people in the experimental group.","interventionNames":["Device: Transcranial ultrasound stimulation and rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The investigators expect to enroll 10 people in the control group.","interventionNames":["Device: Rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Transcranial ultrasound stimulation and rehabilitation","description":"The participants in experimental group would received transcranial ultrasound stimulation and rehabilitation therapy.\n\n* transcranial ultrasound stimulation: during 4 weeks\n* rehabilitation: physiotherapy and occupational therapy (may combine with speech therapy and psychological therapy if needed)","armGroupLabels":["Transcranial ultrasound stimulation and rehabilitation"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Rehabilitation","description":"The participants in control group would received rehabilitation therapy.\n\n- rehabilitation: physiotherapy and occupational therapy (may combine with speech therapy and psychological therapy if needed)","armGroupLabels":["Rehabilitation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Brain observation by image","description":"The investigators would use Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) to observe if there is brain atrophy, hemorrhage, or any other anatomical change in brain.

The test yields 3 scores: a functional ability (FA) score, which quantifies quality of performance; a timed (time) score, quantifying speed of performance in seconds; and a grip strength (strength) score. The FA score uses a 6-point ordinal scale to rate movement quality on 15 items, where 0 indicates no attempt to use the more affected upper extremity and 5 indicates that movement of the affected upper extremity appears to be normal.
