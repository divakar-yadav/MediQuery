The HOH is a light-weight, non-invasive, portable hand robot that provides physical assistance when a patient activates the muscles that open and close the hand. The HOH works by detecting surface EMG muscle activity and therefore requires active participation from the patient throughout the session. Video games linked to the HOH device are specifically designed to work on opening and closing the hand facilitating mass practice and high repetition needed for improving strength and range of motion of muscles."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke, robotics, hand rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"interventional group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This is a single group, interventional pilot study.
