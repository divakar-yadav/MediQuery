A better understanding of how robot assisted therapies affect motor performance on short time scales may help us to prescribe more effective therapy doses to maximize motor recovery after neurological injury.\n\nThe study will allow us to obtain a detailed understanding of the performance of the device as described above."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Arm Weakness as a Consequence of Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stroke Survivors","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Stroke survivors with upper extremity motor impairments","interventionNames":["Device: Compliant Passive Arm Support"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Compliant Passive Arm Support","description":"The device is a mechanical device that consists of two linkages, elastic bands, a commercial posture brace, and a hook-and-loop fastener.
