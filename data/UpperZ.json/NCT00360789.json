Accepted practice in UK physiotherapy is to avoid training of muscle strength after stroke but there is preliminary evidence that it might be effective.\n\nAn observer-blind randomised pilot clinical trial (Phase II). Subjects will be within 3 months of first stroke with some voluntary movement in the paretic upper limb.\n\nA Research Physiotherapist, blinded to measurement, will recruit subjects, allocate subjects to one of three intervention groups using sequentially numbered sealed envelopes containing previously allocated intervention cards and provide interventions. Ten participants will be recruited to each group therefore the trial will recuit 30 participants. The Research Assessor, blinded to intervention allocation will undertake all measurements.\n\nConventional therapy (control) will be provided as normal for the clinical setting, the additional conventional therapy (experimental 1)or functional strength training (experimental 2) will be provided for one hour, five times a week for six weeks. Subjects in the two experimental groups will also receive the conventional therapy standard in their clinical setting.\n\nBlinded measurement will be made before randomisation, at the end of intervention and 12-weeks thereafter. Primary outcomes are the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)and the Nine Hole Peg Test (9HPT). The secondary outcomes are peak torque around the elbow joint in elbow flexion and extension, grip force, pinch force, smoothness of movement during turning a cranked wheel and reciprocal inniveration of biceps and triceps during turning of a cranked wheel.\n\nData will be analysed using descriptive statistics and the estimation of standard deviations will be used to inform a power calculation to estimate sample size for a Phase II randomised controlled trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["STROKE REHABILITATION","pHYSICAL THERAPY"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Conventional UK physical therapy"},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Increased intensity of UK conventional physical therapy (PT)"},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"UK conventional PT plus functional strength training"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)"},{"measure":"Nine Hole Peg Test (9HPT)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"peak torque around the elbow joint in elbow flexion and extension"},{"measure":"grip force"},{"measure":"pinch force"},{"measure":"smoothness of movement during turning a cranked wheel"},{"measure":"reciprocal inneveration of biceps and triceps during turning of a cranked wheel."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Be between one week and three months after stroke when recruited to the study\n* Have some voluntary muscle activity in the paretic upper limb\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Obvious unilateral visuospatial neglect\n* Upper limb movement deficits attributable to non-stroke pathology","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Valerie M Pomeroy, PhD","affiliation":"St George's, University of London","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"St George's Hospital NHS Trust","city":"London","zip":"SW17 0RE","country":"United Kingdom","geoPoint":{"lat":51.50853,"lon":-0.12574}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4244","name":"Asthenia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
