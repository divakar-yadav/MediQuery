To compare the immediate and retention treatment effects of the patients receiving home-based mirror therapy combined with task-oriented training (MTOT) with a hospital-based MTOT group and a hospital conventional rehabilitation group on different aspects of outcomes.\n2. To examine the feasibility, satisfaction, and safety of this novel home-based MTOT program.\n3. To investigate the factors that may affect the efficacy of home-based stroke rehabilitation.","detailedDescription":"In this 3-year study project, we will design a single-blind randomized controlled trial (1) to compare the treatment effects of home-based MTOT with a hospital-based MTOT group and a hospital conventional rehabilitation group, (2) to investigate the feasibility, satisfaction, and safety of this home-based program, and (3) to identify the factors that might influence treatment outcomes. An estimated total of 90 patients with stroke will be recruited in this study. All participants will be randomly assigned to receive home-based MTOT or hospital-based rehabilitation for a 4-week training period (a total of 12 sessions). Before the first treatment session, a client-centered questionnaire will be administered to each patient for identifying individual needs and goals. Feasibility evaluation and caregiver's wellbeing will be also assessed. Outcome measures will be conducted at baseline, immediately after treatment, and 3 months follow-up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["home-based rehabilitation","stroke","combination therapy","client-centered approach","post-acute"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"home-based MTOT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Home-based mirror therapy combined with task-oriented training (MTOT)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: home-based MTOT"]},{"label":"hospital-based therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"hospital-based individualized occupational therapy","interventionNames":["Behavioral: hospital-based therapy"]},{"label":"hospital-based MTOT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"hospital-based mirror therapy combined with task-oriented training (MTOT)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: hospital-based MTOT"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"home-based MTOT","description":"The home-based MTOT group will receive 30 minutes of MT followed by 30 minutes of TOT per session. The intervention will take place in the participant's home environment. During the mirror practices, the patient will seat close to a table which the mirror box will be placed at the mid-sagittal plane. During MT, the participant will be encouraged to actively move their paretic arm and hand concurrently with the mirror reflection of the movement of the nonparetic arm and hand as possible as they can.

The treatment protocol will include: (a) passive range of motion exercises, stretching of the affected limb, or facilitatory and inhibitory techniques, (b) fine motor or dexterity training, (c) arm exercises or gross motor training, (d) muscle strengthening of the affected upper limb, and (e) activities of daily living training or functional task practice.","armGroupLabels":["hospital-based therapy"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"hospital-based MTOT","description":"The hospital-based MTOT group will also receive 30 minutes of MT followed by 30 minutes of TOT per session at a hospital.
