Groups were divided as follow: Group 1 (5times/4wks, total 20 sessions) Conventional occupation therapy + additional occupation therapy(30min). Group 2 (5times/4wks, total 20 sessions) Conventional occupation therapy + RAPAELⓇ Smart Glove digital treatment(30min).\n\nAfter the baseline assessment, patients are divided into two groups by drawing for simple random sampling. Total four times of behavioral and neuroimaging assessments were evaluated at baseline, immediately and 2 weeks after each 10 sessions and at 4 weeks after the final session. Assessment tools are as follow:\n\n1. Primary outcome.\n\n   -Fugl-Meyer assessment,\n2. Motor and sensory function. MMT\\&ROM, Motricity index(MI),Action Research Arm test(ARAT), Box\\&block test, Box\\&Block test, 9-hole pegboard test, Jebsen-Taylor hand function test, Modified Ashworth scale(MAS), Grip strength test, Grasp/pinch power, Visual analogue scale(VAS), Sensory test(two point discrimination, monofilament)\n3. Activity of daily living. Korean version of Modified Barthel index (K-MBI)\n4. Cognition function test. Korean-mini mental state examination (K-MMSE)\n5. Depressive mood. Korean-Geriatric Depression Scale (K-GDS)\n6. Quality of life. Short form-8(SF-8)\n7. Neuroimaging tools. Motor evoked potentials (MEP), Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebral Vascular Accident"],"keywords":["RAPAELⓇ Smart Glove digital treatment system","Rehabilitation","Stroke","Upper limbs"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"RAPAELⓇ Smart Glove group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The experimental group includes 40 stroke patients.
