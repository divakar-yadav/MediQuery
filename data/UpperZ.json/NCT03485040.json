The study will collect demographics and clinical outcome measures, clinical neuroimages, video and robot-kinematic data and neurophysiology data through TMS and EEG in order to quantify the course of motor recovery. The research visits may be accompanied by a comprehensive clinical visit to the Massachusetts General Hospital Neurorecovery Clinic. The goal is to understand the behavioral, neuroanatomic, and neurophysiologic underpinnings of motor recovery toward developing personalized strategies and neurotechnologies to facilitate neurorehabilitation and enable better recovery for people with stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke, Ischemic"],"keywords":["Rehabilitation","Neurorehabilitation","Neurotechnology","Neurorecovery","Neurorestoration"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Arm Motor Assessment","description":"This test provides information about level of upper extremity motor impairment after stroke.
