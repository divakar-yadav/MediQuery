Longitudinal observation allowed the investigators to detect both the initial therapeutic effects as well as the later functional outcomes of orthosis use. The investigators planned to recruit 15 Veterans and non-veterans who had TBI or stroke and upper limb impairment. The study required 29 visits over 22 weeks and was divided into three parts: orthotic fitting, therapy/training (9 weeks), and home use (9 weeks). Therapeutic and functional benefits were evaluated every 2 to 3 weeks over 18 weeks using simple, short clinical tests.","detailedDescription":"This study had two aims: (1) to evaluate therapeutic and neuroplastic effects of a myoelectric upper limb orthosis in conjunction with motor learning-based therapy and (2) to evaluate the functional effects of a myoelectric upper limb orthosis in conjunction with motor learning-based therapy. The investigators planned to recruit 15 Veterans and non-veterans who had Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) or stroke and upper limb impairment, were over 18 years of age and a minimum of 6 months from injury. The study required 29 visits over 22 weeks and was divided into three parts: orthotic fitting, therapy/training (9 weeks), and home use (9 weeks). Therapeutic and functional benefits were evaluated every 2 to 3 weeks over 18 weeks using simple, short clinical tests.\n\nSubjects were enrolled in the study if they met eligibility criteria assessed at a screening visit. Once enrolled subjects were fit with a custom fabricated MyoPro Motion-G elbow-wrist-hand orthosis following standard clinical procedures. This process required up to three visits to cast, trial fit and deliver the orthosis. Subjects then participated in a standard-of-care motor learning based therapy protocol in conjunction with the PERL (\"Push Eat Reach Lift\") training program recommended by Myomo, which consists of a 9 week, 18 session training plan. Every second week, there was one session that combined therapy/training and outcomes evaluation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Traumatic Brain Injury","Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MyoPro + Motor Learning-Based Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects received 9 weeks of motor learning-based therapy in combination with use of MyoPro myoelectric elbow wrist hand orthosis, followed by 9 weeks of home use with a customized exercise program.","interventionNames":["Device: MyoPro Motion-G","Other: Motor Learning-Based Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"MyoPro Motion-G","description":"The MyoPro Motion-G is an elbow-wrist-hand myoelectric orthosis.","armGroupLabels":["MyoPro + Motor Learning-Based Therapy"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Motor Learning-Based Therapy","description":"Motor learning-based (MLB) therapy included movement practice as close to normal as possible, high repetition, progression of challenge, part versus whole task practice, and knowledge of results. Treatment was customized to abilities of each subject and consisted of both MyoPro training and MLB therapy without device. Training with device was progressed using a hierarchy of challenge to increase complexity of movement. MLB therapy without device followed the same hierarchy, incorporating training of movements that could not be accomplished with the device and those that were trained with device. Movement quality was monitored and training practice was incrementally progressed as subject demonstrated improved ability to perform a given task/movement component. Subjects performed a custom home exercise program (HEP) on non-clinic days, increasing repetition as tolerated. At conclusion of in-clinic phase, individuals transitioned to a home phase where they continued to use the HEP.","armGroupLabels":["MyoPro + Motor Learning-Based Therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery for Upper Limb (FMA)","description":"Evaluation of motor impairment of the upper limb.
