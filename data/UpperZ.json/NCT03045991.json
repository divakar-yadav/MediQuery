Empirical evidence shows that exercise combined cognitive training may induce neuroplastic changes that modulate cognitive function. However, evidence about the effects of combined exercise-cognitive trainings on physiological biomarkers, cognitive and physical functions in stroke patients with cognitive decline is still less. The present study aim to investigate the effects of sequential combination of exercise-cognitive trainings on cognitive, physical, and daily function. In addition, the physiological mechanism of the combination training on cognitive function by several biomarkers including the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), antioxidative marker, HbA1c, and plasma lipid level will be investigated. This study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to SEQ group in which sequentially perform physical exercise and cognitive training or to CI group of control intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Patients With Cognitive Decline"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"sequential training group (SEQ)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The sequential training group (SEQ) will first receive 30-minutes aerobic exercise training followed by 30-minutes computerized cognitive training.
