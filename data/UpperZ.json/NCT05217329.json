Literature studies have supported the use of tele-rehabilitation to be as effective as stroke home rehabilitation. Stroke tele-rehabilitation model can use smartphones and apps to practice the mobile health model. This technology with remote rehabilitation have the important characteristics, including ease of use, high-intensity, repetitive exercises, and providing feedback information, to facilitate the recovery of training functions. Nevertheless, effects of tele-rehabilitation analysis for the proximal recovery of the stroke upper limbs still need to be explored. The main purpose of this research is to develop a smart phone with app system for stroke upper limb motor training, and further analyze its feasibility and treatment effects.
