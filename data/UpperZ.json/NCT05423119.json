This longitudinal cohort study aims to identify neurophysiological and behavioural features able to predict arm recovery and how it can change according to provided rehabilitation.","detailedDescription":"Rationale: evidence suggests that integrity of the Cortico-Spinal Tract (CST), valid Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs), age and neurological status are positive prognostic features for better recovery. Concurrently, dosage of rehabilitation therapy is a key factor in promoting functional recovery. However, there are no evidence suggesting whether dose of rehabilitation also influence prediction of UL motor recovery after stroke.\n\nAims: to define (i) predictive features for rehabilitation-induced UL recovery and (ii) the effect of rehabilitation doses.\n\nMethods: stroke patients will be longitudinally enrolled and assessed with Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), blood sample and clinical outcome measures at the beginning (T0) of rehabilitation and after 8 weeks (T1)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["rehabilitation","upper limb","prognosis","neurophysiology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":75,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"conventional therapy","description":"upper limb rehabilitation with and without technologies"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment","description":"Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity is a stroke-specific scale which assesses the upper limb motor functioning in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia.
