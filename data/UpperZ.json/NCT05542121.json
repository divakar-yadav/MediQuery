We will test the safety and feasibility of the gym in a community-based rehabilitation setting. We will treat 36 patients randomized to either a control group getting standard of care therapy and a robot group receiving standard of care with upper limb therapy being given using the robot gym instead of an occupational therapist. Therapy will occur over 4 weeks with two follow-up assessments. Key milestones will be to show that the robot group has the same or better functional outcomes, motivation, and adverse events as the control group. Also to show that the robot gym is a cost-effective solution to increasing access to quality rehabilitation care in low-resource, community-based settings. Success here will validate this potential solution, justify design changes revealed via user-feedback and a larger clinical trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiplegia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard of Care","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"60 min OT sessions; 3 sessions per week; for 4 weeks;-- augmented Standard therapy - consisting of PT, OT and SLP.
