Two randomized groups of patients with stroke were treated with conservative physical therapy and the experimental group was given ROOD's SMT and CIMT in conjunction with conservative rehabilitation. Both, male and female patients meeting the inclusion criteria were included. Patients having other neurological disease, chronic disease, not compatible being participates in CIMT or with any surgical intervention were excluded.","detailedDescription":"The study is aimed at determining the effects of ROOD's sensory motor training along with constraint induced movement therapy in sub-acute stroke and is being conducted in National Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine Islamabad and Pakistan Railway General Hospital, Rawalpindi (Feb 2019-July 2019). Sample size of the study is 36 patients, 36 were included in the study on the basis of inclusion criteria, 18 for each group. Patients were allocated randomly and equally in each group. Similar conservative rehabilitation protocol was designed for both control and experimental group except for experimental group had ROOD's sensory motor training and CIMT training. Patients were examined at 1st visit before administration of any treatment and at 6th week which was also the last one (after completing 6 weeks sessions at alternate days). Baseline evaluation for demographics and assessment was taken. Fugyl-meyer assessment scale(FMA) and Wolf motor function test(WMFT) as measuring tools were used for first and 6th week assessment. 29 patients completed the study while 4 patient from control group and 3 patients from experiment group were lost to follow up and were considered drop outs."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facility","Hemiplegia","Neurorehabilitation","Neural Plasticity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":29,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Rood's Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Rood's sensory motor training along with CIMT","interventionNames":["Other: Rood's Group"]},{"label":"Conventional Physical Therapy Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Conventional Physical Therapy including Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation technique.","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional Physical Therapy Group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Rood's Group","description":"ROOD'S sensory motor training\n\nBrushing \\& strokings 3-5 strokings after 30sec, joint compressions and slow stretch 10 rep of 3 sets on alternative days for consecutive 6 weeks CIMT training\n\nWriting, combing hairs and using spoon activity 1 hour training concentrated on affected limb along with restraint of non affected limb by cotton sling under supervision of therapist and 5 hours training in home plan 3 times a week on alternative days for consecutive 6 weeks along with conventional physical therapy.","armGroupLabels":["Rood's Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional Physical Therapy Group","description":"Conventional training Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitations (PNF) Combination of Isotonics technique 10 rep 3 sets 10 sec hold on alternative days for consecutive 6 weeks Stretching's 10 rep 3 sets on alternative days for consecutive 6 weeks Joint approximation 10 rep of 3 sets on alternative days for 6 weeks","armGroupLabels":["Conventional Physical Therapy Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function Test","description":"Changes from the baseline, Wolf motor function test is a test of motor ability that is use to evaluate the speed and coordination.\n\nTotal of 17 tasks performed by the patient.\n\nScoring:\n\nThe items are rated on a 6-point scale as 0-6.","timeFrame":"6 weeks"},{"measure":"Fugyl-meyer motor assessment scale","description":"Changes from the baseline, Fugyl-meyer assessment scale is use to assess voluntary movements, reflex activity, grasping and coordination of affected limb in stroke.
