The benefits on hand function of this training program will be evaluated. The hypothesize is that the 3-week upper limb hand function training improves finger dexterity.","detailedDescription":"Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS) or stroke often suffer from significantly decreased coordination and have difficulties with precise hand/finger movements during the performance of both basic activities of daily living (ADL), such as dressing, grooming as well as higher ADL, such as cooking, shopping and regular medication intake. The investigators explore the effects of a new, interactive, sensor-home-based upper limb hand training on upper limb related ADL in patients with PD, MS or stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Multiple Sclerosis","Parkinson Disease"],"keywords":["dexterity","training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"sensor-home-based hand training for MS, PD, stroke or control group","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":160,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"smart sensor egg training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"An interactive hand trainer with integrated sensors was developed and can be used as input devices to a training which runs on the smartphone or tablet computer to train different finger, hand, and wrist functions.","interventionNames":["Device: smart sensor egg training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"smart sensor egg training","description":"The portable hand trainer has three principal functionalities: (I) Grasping, (II) Pronosupination, and (III) wrist and finger extension.
