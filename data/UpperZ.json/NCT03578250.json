Motor recovery is usually limited to the first 6 month after the stroke, in which the majority of improvements occur at the first three months. Error augmentation (EA) training using a robotic apparatus was suggested to enhance motor recovery by exploiting the adaptation mechanisms within the intact cerebellum in individuals who sustained cortical stroke.\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate whether error augmentation training for the upper extremity may enhance motor recovery in individuals that sustained cortical stroke.\n\nFifty post-stroke individuals will be randomaly assigned into either EA training (study group- SG) or robotic training in null field environment (control group- CG). Both groups will carry out the same treatment protocol on the robotic device in addition to the standard rehabilitation protocol of the rehabilitation center. Treatment protocol will be consisted of about six training sessions on the robotic device, taken twice or three times a week for two to three weeks. Each training session will be composed of 20-30 minutes upper extremity training with or without EA force field.\n\nMotor performance will be evaluated before and after the treatment protocol by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale.","detailedDescription":"Post-stroke individuals continue to suffer from significant motor impairments years after the stroke.
