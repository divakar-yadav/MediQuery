The study will be divided into two phases. The first phase will be the development of a smartphone app for upper limb function. The second phase of the study will be a pilot study where 10 stroke patients will be recruited and upper limb intervention will be applied through a smartphone app."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","CVA"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Smartphone Rehabilitation Application","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Upper Limb Exercise Protocol:\n\nPassive Exercises ROMs for shoulder, ROMs for elbow, ROMs for wrist,fingers and thumb\n\nActive/Assisted Exercises bilateral shoulder flexion with both hands interlocked, Elbow pronation and supination, Wrist flexion and extension with the help of unaffected hand, Forearm to box, Extend elbow (side), Hand to box (front)\n\nFunctional Activities Lift can, Lift pencil, Lift paper clip, Stack checkers, Flip cards, Fold towel, drinking water from a glass, lifting a glass of water to a level of 90° shoulder flexion with an extended elbow, moving 5 crystals from the table to a box, wiping the table with a towel with the elbow extended, grasping and releasing a 6 cm in diameter tennis ball, combing their hair, Eating with affected hand, opening and closing jars","interventionNames":["Device: Smartphone Rehabilitation Application"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Smartphone Rehabilitation Application","description":"Upper Limb Exercise Protocol:\n\nPassive Exercises\n\nROMs for shoulder, ROMs for elbow, ROMs for wrist,fingers and thumb\n\nActive/Assisted Exercises\n\nbilateral shoulder flexion with both hands interlocked, Elbow pronation and supination, Wrist flexion and extension with the help of unaffected hand, Forearm to box, Extend elbow (side), Hand to box (front)\n\nFunctional Activities\n\nLift can, Lift pencil, Lift paper clip, Stack checkers,Flip cards, Fold towel, drinking water from a glass, lifting a glass of water to a level of 90° shoulder flexion with an extended elbow, moving 5 crystals from the table to a box, wiping the table with a towel with the elbow extended, grasping and releasing a 6 cm in diameter tennis ball, combing their hair, Eating with affected hand, opening and closing jars","armGroupLabels":["Smartphone Rehabilitation Application"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)","description":"The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) quantifies upper limb motor ability through timed and functional tasks.
