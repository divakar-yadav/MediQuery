Indeed, functional and cognitive outcomes will be reported, and data about feasibility and safety of the rehabilitation program will also be recorded.","detailedDescription":"This is an observational descriptive study that will be performed in an inpatient intensive rehabilitation unit. Stroke patients admitted in our neuro-rehabilitation unit who follow the inclusion criteria, will be invited to participate. The main objective of the study is to register the time spent in different activities during therapy session performed in the intensive rehabilitation program. At the end of each session a sum of the minutes spent in each activity will be performed and at the end of the rehabilitation program the average of time spent in each therapy will be calculated. Indeed, throughout these data the total amount of time spent on rehabilitation (hours and minutes) will be obtained. Secondary objectives are to report changes on functional, cognitive and health status outcomes during different time-frames. This outcomes will be assessed at baseline (admission on neuro-rehabilitation unit), at discharge of rehabilitation unit (average of 30 days after stroke), at 3 months and 6 months after stroke. Safety and Feasibility of the program will also de recorded. Feasibility will be assessed by adherence to the prescribed program, including the register of the following parameters: attendance rate (number of planned sessions attended), training session modification (dose reduction or early termination of the individual session) and reasons for training interruption (2 or more days without training session) as fatigue, dizziness, fever... Safety will be assessed registering any adverse event related to rehab (ie. episodes of falls,..)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Intensive Rehabilitation","Time","Physiotherapy","Occupational Therapy","Speech language therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","description":"Subacute stroke patients admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation facility.","interventionNames":["Other: Observational study"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Observational study","description":"This is an observational study in which the amount of therapy performed during the rehabilitation program will be registered.Data regarding feasibility and safety of the program will be also recorded.
