This study could lead to the development of a product that could allow people with arm weakness or arm paralysis to use the NuroSleeve and similar devices to improve arm health and independent function.","detailedDescription":"People can develop arm weakness due to stroke and other neurological conditions. Portable powered braces and functional electrical stimulation can help restore functional arm movement in these individuals. Powered braces and muscle stimulation may be triggered by detecting movement or electrical activity of proximal muscles that the person still can control. The overall objective of this study is to establish that children and adults with chronic, stable neurological motor impairment can achieve voluntary control over the NuroSleeve upper extremity orthosis and functional electrical stimulation system, and that they can use this voluntary control to perform functionally beneficial tasks to enhance independence, mental and physical health. While myoelectric prostheses have been studied for decades in children with limb loss, it is necessary to gather pilot data on the use of orthoses with optional electrical stimulation in people with intact yet paralyzed limbs. These adults and children have persistent motor deficits even after intensive physical and occupational therapy. The NuroSleeve and similar devices could help all people who have arm weakness."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neurologic Diseases","Hemiparesis","Quadriplegia","Muscular Dystrophies","Arthrogryposis","Spinal Cord Injuries","Charcot-Marie-Tooth","Stroke","Weakness of Extremities as Sequela of Stroke","Weakness Due to Upper Motor Neuron Dysfunction","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","Spinal Muscular Atrophy","Arm Paralysis","Cerebral Palsy"],"keywords":["Arm weakness, paralysis","orthosis","functional electrical stimulation","brace"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment Arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will received a customized NuroSleeve and undergo 8 weeks of occupational therapy using the NuroSleeve (135 minutes per week for 8 weeks: this can be done as 45 minutes three times per week, 68 minute sessions twice per week, or one 135 minute once per week).","interventionNames":["Device: Neurosleeve"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Neurosleeve","description":"Myoelectric devices for restoration of independent arm function","armGroupLabels":["Treatment Arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Canadian Occupational Performance Measure score at 8 weeks","description":"The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is an individualized measure designed for use by occupational therapists to detect self-perceived change in occupational performance problems over time.

The sum of all subscales are added to compute the total score. The total score ranges between 0 to 57. The higher score is considered to be better outcome.\n\nFrom: Yozbatiran et al.
