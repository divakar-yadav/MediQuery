Although the treatment effects were supported in studies, there are still limitations in clinical intervention. The study will use the robot-assisted hand rehabilitation with a Gloreha device. Thirty patients with moderate motor deficits were recruited and randomized into 2 treatment groups, AB or BA (A = 12 times of robot-assisted hand rehabilitation, B = 12 times of standard therapy) for 12 weeks of treatment (Sixty minutes a time, twice a week), 1 month of break between conditions for washout period. The performance was assessed by a blinded assessor for five times (pre-test1, post-test 1, pre-test2, post-test 2, follow up at three month). The outcome measures Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Limb section(FMA-UE),Box and block test(BBT), Maximal voluntary contraction(MVC) of extensor digitorum communis(EDC), Abductor pollicis brevis(APB), Flexor digitorum(FD), Dynanometer, Semmes-Weinstein hand monofilament (SWM), Revision of the Nottingham Sensory Assessment (EmNSA), Modified Barthel Index. Collected data will be analyzed with ANOVA test by SPSS version 20.0, and alpha level was set at 0.05. The hypothesis are robot-assisted hand rehabilitation with a Gloreha device has positive effects on sensory, motor, hand function, and ADL ability among patients with stroke.","detailedDescription":"Many stroke survivors suffered problems with the upper extremity, such as paresis, synergy movement, hypertonicity, jag movement, sensory deficit. An inability to use the upper extremity in daily life can lead to loss of independence with ADLs and of important occupations (eg,work, driving). For individuals with more severe paresis, the potential for recovery of upper extremity function is greatly reduced. Robotic therapy can deliver larger amounts of upper extremity movement practice for these individuals. Although the Robotic therapy appears to provide some benefit for upper extremity motor abilities and participation but is of uncertain utility compared with dose-matched conventional upper limb exercise therapies. Objective: To investigate the effects of robot-assisted hand rehabilitation with a Gloreha device on sensory, motor, and ADL ability for patients with stroke.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Thirty patients with moderate motor deficits were recruited and randomized into 2 treatment groups, AB or BA (A = 12 times of robot-assisted hand rehabilitation, B = 12 times of standard therapy) for 12 weeks of treatment (Sixty minutes a time, twice a week), 1 month of break between conditions for washout period.
