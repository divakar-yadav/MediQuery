There are various therapy options that are used in the rehabilitation of patients. Some studies have shown that, in addition to unilateral arm training, bilateral arm training can also lead to positive results in treatment and is a useful addition to therapy. The newly developed app requires the coordination of both arms in certain time sequences and intensities or rhythms and addresses different sensory modalities (visual, auditory and kinesthetic). The aim of the study is to examine whether tablet-based training improves bimanual coordination."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Results are evaluated by an independent scientists and group assignment is pseudonymised.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tablet","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention group trained bimanual coordination once a day for about 31 minutes on a total of ten days using a tablet game.

In this therapy unit, the control group uses the \"Aximo\". This is a comb stand and so-called \"rolls\" with which plugging tasks can be practiced. The patients should push the rolls into the stand fields with the affected hand. With the plug-in game, the patients can complete different tasks that challenge and train their hand-eye coordination, their fine motor skills and their ability to grasp things (e.g. following a specific pattern based on a template or putting colors in a specific order).","interventionNames":["Other: ergotherapeutic training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Tablet-based training","description":"Each task is performed for one minute, followed by a 2-minute break.

The dice are then counted in the outer compartment. The dice that fall from one hand to the other in the middle compartment are counted separately.
