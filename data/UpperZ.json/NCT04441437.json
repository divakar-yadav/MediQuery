The participants were randomly divided into two groups: the splint group and the control group. The subjects in the splint group received 1-hour task-oriented training with wearing a customized dynamic hand splint, totally 15 times in a duration of one month plus conventional rehabilitation programs. The subjects in the control group received the same treatments but without splint used. Evaluations including Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), active range of motion (AROM), grip strength, Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Motor Activity Log 30(MAL), and F/M ratio were performed at baseline, post-training, and 2 months later after the intervention finished, and the evaluators were blinded to the grouping of the subjects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Brain Injuries"],"keywords":["spasticity","dynamic hand splint","stroke","traumatic brain injury"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":35,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Splint Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"1-hour task-oriented training with wearing a customized dynamic hand splint, totally 15 times in a duration of one month.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Task-oriented training with a dynamic hand splint"]},{"label":"No-Splint Group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"1-hour task-oriented training without wearing a customized dynamic hand splint, totally 15 times in a duration of one month.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Task-oriented training without a dynamic hand splint"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Task-oriented training with a dynamic hand splint","description":"In addition to conventional rehabilitation programs (therapy-as-usual), the subject in the splint group received 1-hour task-oriented training with wearing a customized dynamic hand splint, totally 15 times in a duration of one month.
