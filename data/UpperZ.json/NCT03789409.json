The aim of this study is to evaluate the neurological, functional and clinical efficacy of intermittent fasting in patients after acute ischemic stroke.","detailedDescription":"In order to verify the validity and clinical efficacy of intermittent fasting for neurological and functional effects of ischemic cerebral infarction, the first ischemic stroke (diagnosed within 1 year through brain MRI / CT) patients will be randomly assigned to intermittent fasting group or control group. In both groups, physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy will be provided during 3 hours in total a day. The intermittent fasting group should maintain intermittent fasting for no less than 12 hours or more every day during the rehabilitation period (at least 1 week), and the control group is able to eat all of the hospital meals and all the participants want without any time limit. The efficacy of intermittent fasting is to be verified by performing the electro-physiological tests and functional evaluations before participation, 1st week, 2nd weeks after participation, before discharge, 3 months, and 6 months after the stroke onset."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke","Intermittent Fasting"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":68,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intermittent Fasting","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Over rehabilitation treatment during and admission (at least 1 week), intermittent fasting (IF) for more than 12 hours (water can be allowed).
