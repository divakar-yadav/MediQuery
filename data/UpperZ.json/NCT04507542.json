A modified version of the MST protocol has been created (hereafter, referred as enriched MST, eMST) to include (i) a home-based self-training program using an app for electronic tablets and (ii) weekly group sessions of musical playing strengthening the motivational and emotional components of music playing. A randomised controlled trial will be conducted to test the effectiveness of this enriched MST (eMST) protocol in improving motor functions, cognition, emotional well-being and quality of life when compared to a program of home-based exercises utilizing the Graded Repetitive Arm Supplementary Program (GRASP). Sixty stroke patients will be recruited and randomly allocated to an eMST group (n=30) or a control GRASP intervention group (n=30). Patients will be evaluated before and after a 10-week intervention, as well as at 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome of the study is the functionality of the paretic upper limb measured with the Action Research Arm Test. Secondary outcomes include other motor and cognitive functions, emotional well-being and quality of life measures as well as self-regulation and self-efficacy outcomes. We hypothesize that patients treated with eMST will show larger improvements in their motor and cognitive functions, emotional well-being and quality of life than patients treated with a home-based GRASP intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","rehabilitation","music therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A parallel-group randomised controlled trial will be conducted with participants being randomised to either an enriched Music-Supported Therapy group or to a control treatment group receiving the Graded Repetitive Arm Supplementary Program (GRASP, Harris et al., 2009).","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"A clinical researcher with expertise in stroke rehabilitation will perform the evaluations and will be blinded to participants' group allocation.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Enriched Music-Supported Therapy group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the eMST-group will follow a 10-week program of Enriched Music-Supported Therapy.
