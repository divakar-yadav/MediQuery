Participants will include stroke patients with upper-limb hemiparesis and can expect to be on study for approximately 4 months.","detailedDescription":"Ongoing research (NCT02098265) suggests that noninvasive EEG driven Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems hold the potential for facilitating recovery in the chronic phase after stroke by synchronizing central or brain activity with peripheral movements and thereby harnessing brain plasticity.\n\nThe specific aims of this study are:\n\nAim 1: To investigate the efficacy of active FES vs. passive FES, as measured by changes in behavioral measures. The investigators hypothesize that improvements in motor function will be significantly greater using the active FES therapy than the passive FES therapy.\n\nAim 2: To investigate the relationship between brain functional activation patterns and behavior changes induced by active vs. passive FES intervention. The investigators hypothesize that changes induced by active FES (as measured by brain fMRI and EEG measures) will show greater adaptive brain reorganization changes (i.e. brain changes that correlate with improved outcomes) than that induced by the passive FES.\n\nAim 3: To investigate the relationship between brain white matter integrity and behavior changes induced by active vs. passive FES intervention. The investigators hypothesize that changes induced by active FES (as measured by brain DTI measures) will show greater adaptive brain reorganization changes (i.e. brain changes that correlate with improved outcomes) than that induced by the passive FES."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["aneurysm","transient ischemic attack"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":144,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Passive FES","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Subjects randomized to this control group will be asked to participate in a passive FES intervention or non-EEG guided muscle stimulation.

Each section is scored separately and the scores added for a total possible range of scores from 0-57 where the higher the score, the complete and efficient the movement.

The 4 physical function domains (strength, hand function, activities of daily living (ADL)/instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and mobility) will be collapsed to a physical function subscale.
