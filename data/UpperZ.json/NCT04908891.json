Two main phases are present in this study:\n\nIn phase A: the psychometric properties of two tests: Clinical Scapular protocol (ClinScaP) in PwMS (Persons with Multiple Sclerosis) and healthy controls.\n\n1. To investigate the test-retest reliability of the Clinical Scapular Protocol (ClinScaP) and the Reaching Performance Scale (RPS) in PwMS\n2. To investigate the discriminative of the ClinScaP between PwMS and healthy controls\n3. To investigate the discriminative of the RPS between PwMS and healthy controls\n4. To investigate the concurrent validity of ClinScaP and RPS in PwMS, compared with upper limb dysfunction measurements.\n\n   In phase B:\n5. To investigate the prevalence of trunk, scapula and upper limb impairments in PwMS and stroke patients.\n6.
