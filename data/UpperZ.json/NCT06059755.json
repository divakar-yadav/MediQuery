The reduction of obesity and improvement in quality of life are directly correlated. Many post-stroke patients experience persistent upper extremity dysfunction. The study aims to compare cross-education non-paretic limb training versus mirror therapy on upper limb strength and dexterous movement of hand in stroke survivors This randomized clinical trial will be conducted at DHQ Hospital Sargodha over a duration of six months. The sample size will consist of 26 participants. Participants which meet the inclusion criteria will be selected through Non probability convenience sampling technique, which will further be randomized through computer engendered in blocks by using basic number generator.13 participants will be assigned to Cross education group and 13 participants will be assigned to Mirror Therapy group. Data will be using various assessment tools, including the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) for functional limitation, Fugl-Meyer Assessment-upper extremity (FMA-UE), Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) for hand dexterity and function. Hand held dynamometer will be used for Grip Strength Test. Pre intervention assessment will be conducted for both groups. The effects of intervention will be measured at pretreatment ,3rd week and post intervention. Data analysis will be performed by using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) 23 version.","detailedDescription":"A stroke or CVA is characterized by the sudden onset of focal neurological dysfunction symptoms that persist for more than 24 hours (or cause death earlier) and are brought on by an acute vascular injury to a specific area of the brain. Overall, a stroke creates a blockage in the delivery of blood and oxygen to a particular region of the brain, which results in cell death, long-term or lifelong impairments, or even death. Issues with paralysis, motor control, pain-related sensory problems, language usage or comprehension, thinking, memory, and emotional challenges are just a few examples of disabilities.\n\nStroke can be ischemic or hemorrhagic. Over 100 diseases are associated with ischemic stroke, making it heterogeneous. It is the most common type of stroke and accounts for 87% of all strokes. Ischemic stroke is further divided into two groups; thrombotic stroke (the formation of clot or plaque in blood vessels within the brain) and embolic stroke (the formation of clot or plaque somewhere else in the body and travels to blood vessel of the brain through blood stream).\n\nAtherosclerosis, arterial dissection, and artery-to-artery embolism are all examples of large vessel disease. The primary small vessel diseases causing lacunar strokes are lipohyalinosis and atherosclerosis. Intracerebral hemorrhage, which can occur deep (basal ganglia, brainstem), cerebellum, or lobar, accounts for about 15% of strokes. About 20% of intracerebral hemorrhages are brought on by macro vascular lesions (vascular malformations, aneurysms, cavernomas), venous sinus thrombosis, or other uncommon causes; these are particularly significant in young patients.\n\nLiterature review A systematic and evidence based search of relevant literature was performed by utilizing PubMed and Google Scholar as search engines. Search term for the initial literature review was post-stroke mirror therapy, post-stroke cross education, comparison of mirror therapy versus cross education non paretic limb training, upper limb strength and hand dexterity.\n\nO. van der Groen et al. (2023) studied the Corticospinal and intracortical responses from both motor cortices following unilateral concentric versus eccentric contractions and compared responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation(TMS) in both motor cortices following single sessions of unilateral ECC and CON exercise of the elbow flexor and concluded that These findings suggest that responses after a single bout of exercise may not reflect longer term adaptations.\n\nS. Karamat et al. (2022) compared the effects of task-based mirror therapy and Repetitive Facilitation Exercise on upper limb function in post stroke patient. The study concluded that mirror therapy and repetitive facilitation Exercise both were found to be effective in improving upper limb motor functions of acute stroke patients. However, Mirror therapy has shown significant effects in upper extremity functional index."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemiplegia and Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Paresis, Mirror therapy, Motor skills, Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":26,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group A: Cross education","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"For strength training resistance exercises with a load of 60% of one repetition maximum will be performed targeting the muscles involved in upper limb function.
