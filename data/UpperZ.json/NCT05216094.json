It is estimated that 50 chronic stroke cases will be recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental group (n=25) and the control group (n=25). The experimental group received a 12-week action health App combined with behavioral change technology and task-oriented upper limb exercise strategy intervention. The control group received a 12-week sham control and a traditional home rehabilitation intervention program. Both groups received pre-test, post-test (12 weeks) and follow-up assessment (4 weeks).

This study will adopt a double-blind evaluation design, and the evaluation contents include Fugl-Meyer Upper Limb Motor Function Scale, Grip Strength Assessment, Box and Block Test, MAL-28, Stroke Impact Scale and System Utility Scale. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, Repeated ANOVA, and correlation analysis.\n\nThe results of this research are expected to develop a mobile health app that combines behavioral change technology and task-oriented exercise strategies, which can be applied to stroke patients at home or in the community to promote the execution of high-intensity and high-repetition upper limb motor function exercises, thereby improving upper limb and daily life. life function."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":48,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"smart phone intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"smart phone intervention group stroke subjects completed smart phone App tasks with affected upper limb or bilateral arm movement for 12 weeks","interventionNames":["Other: smart phone App"]},{"label":"conventional group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"stroke subjects receive conventional rehabilitation home program for 12 weeks","interventionNames":["Other: conventional rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"smart phone App","description":"stroke subjects completed tasks-oriented program demoed in the smart phone app with affected upper limb or bilateral arm movement for 12 weeks","armGroupLabels":["smart phone intervention group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"conventional rehabilitation","description":"stroke subjects receive conventional rehabilitation home program with smart phone app ,without task-oriented program demoed function, for 12 weeks","armGroupLabels":["conventional group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Box and Block Test","description":"The Box and Block Test (BBT) measures unilateral gross manual dexterity.
