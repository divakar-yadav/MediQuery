The primary hypothesis is that the combination of assisted movement and enhanced sensation from muscle vibration can increase the amount of motor recovery in individuals disabled by a stroke.","detailedDescription":"Approximately 700,000 U.S. citizens have a stroke each year with about half ending up with significant motor disabilities. There are an estimated 5 million stroke survivors in the U.S., making strokes the leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S.. Existing rehabilitation therapies have not been effective in returning all stroke survivors to full motor recovery.\n\nThe AMES device was designed to be able to provide therapy for the hand (fingers/wrist). In this 18 treatment sessions, double-blinded, control study, AMES therapy will be provided in addition to the usual physician-ordered rehabilitation during the sub-acute period following a stroke. Those control subject who complete the Phase 1 placebo sessions will have the opportunity to cross-over to participate in a AMES treatment group for a Phase 2."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Stroke"],"keywords":["Sub-acute care","Robotics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Single crossover for only the control group participants from the controlled part of the study.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":83,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Test-Phase 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The Test Group receives 18 half-hour AMES (Assisted Movement with Enhanced Sensation) treatments with the AMES device (Test) in which the hand or wrist is moved, and the subject assists the motion while vibration (60 pulses/sec) is applied to the lengthening muscle.
