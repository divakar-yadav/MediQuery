A total of 40 patients (20 patients with right hemiplegia and 20 patients with left hemiplegia) were enrolled in our prospective, randomized and controlled trial. Patients were randomized in to three groups. The first group consists of 10 right hemiplegia patients and the second group consists of 10 left hemiplegia patients. First and second group of patients had 10 sessions of constraint induced movement therapy as groups of 4, 5 days a week. Each patient had modified constraint induced movement therapy 1 hour a day with professional support and performed home program by themselves 3 hours a day. Patients' less affected hands were limited by the help of a glove %50 of the time they were awake.
