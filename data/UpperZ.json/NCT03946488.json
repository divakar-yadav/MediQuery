The improvement of the grasp abilities remains a challenge in the 50% of post-stroke subjects who have not recovered functional grasping due to paralysis of the finger's muscles (lack of active opening of the hand).\n\nThe use of functional electrical stimulation of the prehension muscles in order to restore grasp abilities, called grasp neuroprosthesis (GP), remained confidential in post-stroke subjects while their development was important in tetraplegic subjects. GP can provide a correct hand opening with significant functional gain, but one of the major issues corresponds to the control modalities that are not adapted to the specific impairments of post-stroke subjects.\n\nThis project proposes to assess the functional contribution of an innovative autopilot closed-loop GP targeting the extensor muscles of the fingers. The main hypothesis is that the use of GP will restore grasping abilities in subjects who have lost this ability due to post-stroke paralysis.\n\nThe main objective is to assess the impact of using an autopilot closed-loop GP on the ability to perform a standardized task of grasping, moving and releasing either a glass (palmar grasp) or a spoon (key pinch), compared to the absence of GP use.\n\nThe secondary objectives of the study are: (1) to assess the impact of the GP on unimanual grasp; (2) to assess which are the preferential modes of control; (3) to assess the psycho-social impacts of GP, and (4) to assess the subject's satisfaction and tolerance to the characteristics and use of GP.\n\nThe investigators plan to include 20 post-stroke hemiplegic subjects over a period of 9 months as part of a prospective, monocentric, multi-crossover, blinded evaluation study. Subjects will have active finger extension deficit secondary to stroke, with preservation of proximal movements. Each subject will be his own control (self-pairing).\n\nEach subject will be evaluated three times, the protocol adding approximately 1½ hours of daily assessment to routine care already received. The first visit will collect clinical data after informed consent collection. The second visit will allow to choose the optimal mode of control of the GP among 8 modalities. The third visit will test the functional gain provided by the use of GP, by comparing the success or failure of carrying out functional tasks with inactive and active GP."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Hand function restoration","Prehension","Closed-loop controlled neuroprosthesis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":11,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Inactive neuroprosthesis","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"},{"label":"Active neuroprosthesis","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Functional electrical stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Functional electrical stimulation","description":"Functional electrical stimulation of finger's muscles in order to open the hand","armGroupLabels":["Active neuroprosthesis"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of success of the main functional task","description":"The main functional task consist of grasping, moving and releasing either a glass (palmar grasp) or a spoon (key grip): the task (palmar grasp or key grip) preferred by the patient will be chosen.\n\nThe assessment will consist of 24 trials with the active or inactive neuroprosthesis (12 activated and 12 inactivated), the order of the trials with / without neuroprosthesis being randomized in blocks of at least three trials.
