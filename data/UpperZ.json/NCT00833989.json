The present study is the first in patients with stroke. The main aim of this study is to select tolerated doses of GSK249320 that can be used in future trials to evaluate its efficacy in improving clinical function in patients recovering from stroke. This clinical trial is designed as a placebo-controlled, single-blind, multicenter study to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of escalating repeat IV doses of GSK249320. Three sequential dose escalation cohorts (1, 5 and 15 mg/kg) are planned, with 8 patients on placebo and 8 on active in cohort 1 and 4 patients on placebo and 8 on active in cohorts 2 and 3. Each patient will receive 2 repeat IV doses 9 ± 1 days apart and assessments will extend to at least 16 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischaemic Attack, Transient"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":42,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"PLACEBO","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: PLACEBO"]},{"label":"ACTIVE","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: GSK249320"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"GSK249320","description":"I.V. infusion","armGroupLabels":["ACTIVE"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"PLACEBO","description":"Placebo","armGroupLabels":["PLACEBO"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)","description":"AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.

It is reliable, valid and responsive to change in the stroke population. BBS is a staff-assessed measure that requires the participant to perform 14 activities that evaluate ability to maintain balance. The BBS typically takes 10-15minute to complete. Participants were not allowed to use assistive devices while performing the activities. Each activity was evaluated by direct observation of the participant's performance and was scored on a 5-point ordinal scale (0-4) where a score of 0 represents inability to perform the activity and a score of 4 represents independence in the activity. The minimum total score on the BBS was 0 and maximum was 56. Baseline assessments were recorded at Day 5 of the study. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.","populationDescription":"All Subjects population.
