The two trials will have identical study designs and interventions. The overall goal of this research project is to provide scientific evidence of the treatment effects of unilateral and bilateral hybrid therapies in subacute and chronic stroke patients and thus to contribute to evidence-based stroke rehabilitation and translational research for neurorehabilitation.","detailedDescription":"The first aim of the project will be to compare treatment effects between hybrid rehabilitation and conventional rehabilitations (CR) on motor function, daily functions, mobility, quality of life, and kinematic variables. We hypothesize that patients receiving hybrid rehabilitation will gain more recovery than patients receiving CR in proximal (e.g., motor function) and in distal outcomes (e.g., quality of life) and that patients in the hybrid rehabilitation groups will show more genuine upper extremity motor recovery than those in conventional rehabilitation groups, as indicated by kinematic measures.\n\nThe second aim will be to examine the comparative treatment effects between unilateral hybrid and bilateral hybrid rehabilitation on various aspects of outcomes. We hypothesize that the unilateral group will improve more on outcomes associated with distal upper limb (UL) control and that the bilateral rehabilitation group will improve more on outcomes associated with proximal UL control.\n\nThird, we will collect biomarker indexes before and after the interventions to monitor the changes of oxidative stress and inflammatory levels."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["comparative efficacy research","combination therapy","neurorehabilitation","robotic rehabilitation","restraint therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Unilateral Hybrid (InMotion3 plus CIT) Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive 3 weeks of robot-assisted therapy (RT) using the InMotion3 Wrist Robot, followed by 3 weeks of CIT training.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Unilateral Hybrid (InMotion3 plus CIT) Intervention"]},{"label":"Bilateral Hybrid (BMT plus BAT) Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in this bilateral treatment group will receive 3 weeks of RT using the Bi-Manu-Track (BMT) robot (Reha-Stim Co., Berlin, Germany), followed by 3 weeks of therapist-based BAT.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Bilateral Hybrid (BMT plus BAT) Intervention"]},{"label":"Conventional Rehabilitation (CR)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The CR intervention will be designed to match the duration and intensity of the hybrid interventions.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Conventional Rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Unilateral Hybrid (InMotion3 plus CIT) Intervention","description":"During the 3-week InMotion3 period, participants will receive 5 minutes of muscle tone normalization preparation and passive range of motion, then 85 minutes of training using the InMotion3 robot.

The 33 upper limb items measure the movement and reflexes of the shoulder/elbow/forearm, wrist, hand, and coordination/speed. They are scored on a 3-point ordinal scale (0-cannot perform, 1-performs partially, 2-performs fully). The maximum score is 66, indicating optimal recovery. The sub-score of a proximal shoulder/elbow (FMA s/e: 0-42) and a distal hand/wrist (FMA h/w: 0-24) will be also calculated to investigate the treatment effects on separate upper extremity elements. The reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the FMA in stroke patients have been shown to be good.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 18 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)","description":"The WMFT was originally designed to assess the effects of CIT on the return of arm function for stroke and traumatic brain injury. The assessment requires the participant to perform 15 function-based and 2 strength-based tasks. The tasks are averaged to produce a score in seconds that ranges from 0 to 120 seconds. For functional ability scoring, we used a 6-point ordinal scale where 0 indicates \"does not attempt with the involved arm\" and 5 indicates \"arm does participate; movement appears to be normal.\" The clinimetrics of the WMFT has been ascertained in stroke patients.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 18 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in MyotonPro","description":"The MyotonPRO represents a noninvasive way to characterize the viscoelastic properties of skeletal muscle in vivo. Three measurement parameters in the MyotonPRO: F - Frequency, Hz, characterizes muscle tone; D - Decrement, characterizes muscle elasticity; S - Stiffness, N/m, characterizes muscle stiffness. The working principles of the MyotonPRO are as follows: the testing end of the MyotonPRO will be placed perpendicular to the skin surface above the muscle to be measured, a brief mechanical impulse will be applied, shortly followed by a quick release to the muscle through an acceleration probe, and the damped oscillations of the muscle response will be recorded by the acceleration transducer at the testing end of the device. The oscillation graph creates during the measurement expresses the acceleration of the testing end.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 18 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT)","description":"The 10MWT assess mobility function by measuring the time and the numbers of strides required to walk 10 meters under two conditions: (1) with the self-pace of each participant (self-pace); (2) with the speed that the participants walked as soon as possible. The velocity and stride length of the participant are calculated. Research has validated the 10MWT in measuring mobility in stroke.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 18 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in Actigraphy","description":"The activity monitors will be used to provide a direct and objective measure of the amount of the impaired arm movement outside the laboratory. This measure, quantitatively recording the amount of activity in free-living conditions, will be used to reflect increase in the amount of affected arm use over time. The participants will be asked to wear an activity monitor, Actigraphy (Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., New York), on each wrist for 3 consecutive days to measure what amount they actually do in their daily life before and immediately after treatment. The Actigraphy can be attached to the subject's limb and measures the motion of that limb through an accelerometer. In this project, acceleration will be sampled at 10 Hz and summed over a user-specified epoch. The recording epoch will be 2 seconds; recording capacity will be approximately 72 hours. The ratio of affected to non-affected arm movement is a reliable and valid real-life measure of treatment outcome.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 18 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in Functional Independence Measure (FIM)","description":"The FIM consists of 18 items grouped into 6 subscales measuring self-care, sphincter control, transfer, locomotion, communication, and social cognition ability. Each item is rated from 1 to 7 (maximum score 126) based on the required level of assistance to perform the tasks (e.g., 1-complete assistance and 7-complete independence). A higher score on any subscale indicates a less disability. The FIM has been shown to have good inter-rater reliability, construct validity, and discriminant validity.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 18 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in Motor Activity Log (MAL)","description":"The MAL consists of 30 structured questions to interview how the patients rate the frequency (amount of use subscale) and quality (quality of movement subscale) of movements while using their affected arm to accomplish each of the 30 daily activities. The score of each item ranges from 0 to 5, and the higher scores indicate more frequently used or higher quality of movements. The summary score is the mean of the item scores. The clinimetric properties of the MAL in stroke patients have been validated.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 18 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in ABILHAND Questionnaire","description":"The ABILHAND Questionnaire will be used to evaluate the ability of the UL in functional activities. It consists of 23 bimanual activities that measure subjectively perceived difficulty in performing some common activities in daily living, such as buttoning, cutting nails, and opening a bottle. The scale ranges from 0 to 3 (0 = cannot perform, 1 = performs partially or with great difficulty, 2 = performs with some difficulty, 3 = performs fully). Its reliability and construct validity has been confirmed.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 18 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale (NEADL)","description":"he NEADL consists of 22 items scored on the basis of the requirement for help in performing the activity. There are four subscales (mobility, domestic, leisure and kitchen) and a total score. The scores range from 0 to 22, with higher scores representing better function.
