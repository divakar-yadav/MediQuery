The purpose of this study is to examine changes in power output, oxygen consumption, cognitive function, and quality of life after 8 weeks of smart trainer arm ergometry exercise training among individuals with post-stroke limb impairment.","detailedDescription":"Individuals with physical disabilities show much lower rates of exercise participation than their able-bodied peers. Much of the reason for the low rates of activity among this population comes from the presence of barriers. Lack of motivation, lack of transportation, lack of accessible facilities and equipment, and cost are all factors that discourage exercise participation among those with disabilities. Based on these factors, there is a need for accessible enjoyable exercise options for people with physical disabilities. The smart trainer ergometer (also known as the Advanced Virtual Exercise Environment Device) is comprised of an ergometer with foot and hand pedals, and a visual display in front of the user that can show a variety of scenic pathways.\n\nIn our previous protocol (IRB-300001384) we explored the power output curves of people post stroke compared with non-impaired individuals during one arm versus two arm cycling exercise using the smart trainer arm ergometer. The work demonstrated the potential benefit of interactive exercise for those with physical disabilities. The purpose of this study is to examine changes in power output, oxygen consumption, cognitive function, and quality of life after 8 weeks of smart trainer arm ergometry exercise training among individuals who have a stroke-based limb impairment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Exercise","Arm ergometer","Virtual environment","Disability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm Ergometer Smart Trainer Cycling","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will participate in an 8-week exercise training program using the smart trainer.","interventionNames":["Other: Arm ergometer smart trainer cycling program"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Arm ergometer smart trainer cycling program","description":"Arm ergometer exercise training using the smart trainer.","armGroupLabels":["Arm Ergometer Smart Trainer Cycling"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Oxygen Consumption from Baseline to end of Week 8","description":"Oxygen consumption (VO2) as measured during a graded exercise test using a portable metabolic system","timeFrame":"8 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Stroke Severity from Baseline to end of Week 8","description":"NIH Stroke Scale Test.
