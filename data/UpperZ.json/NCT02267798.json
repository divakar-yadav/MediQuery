The relationship between intensity of rehabilitation and clinical outcomes, recently emphasized, has generated a great interest for technological high-intensity interventions. However, their effects compared to traditional interventions as well the involved biological mechanisms remain uncertain. The present Strategic Program aims to predict the treatment efficacy in specific rehabilitation profiles, to improve the use of \"targeted\" therapies and the individual management of patients affected by stroke and to transfer these findings into rehabilitative strategies.","detailedDescription":"Primary endpoint: Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity (FM-UE) Secondary endpoints: Box and Block Test (BBT), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS); motor cortex excitability (TMS); Electromyography analysis of muscle activation patterns during upper extremity movements; measurements of cerebral perfusion (NIRS); circulating biomarkers (see Figure 3 and Table 1). Overall assessments will be performed pre-, mid-, post-treatment and at 6-months follow-up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Arm Motor Recovery"],"keywords":["Stroke","Rehabilitation","Arm motor recovery","biological biomarkers"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":64,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"arm training combined with FES","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Arm training protocol Training sessions will last for 60 minutes and will focus on repetitive tasks that incorporate multidirectional reaching actions.
