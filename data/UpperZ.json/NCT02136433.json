In addition, we aim to examine brain plasticity following treatment with the new tablet applications. We hypothesize that training with a tablet would prove to be more effective than traditional exercises. We expect to observe neuroplastic changes in the brain in patients who practiced finger movements using the tablet."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Injury","Stroke"],"keywords":["Hand","Rehabilitation","Stroke","Brain-injury","Tablet"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tablet - self exercise","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Existing tablet Apps that encourage finger movement in a fun manner while playing a game will be used.
