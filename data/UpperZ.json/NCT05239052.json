Recently, with the development of rehabilitation technology, the clients can receive more individualized physical activities intervention. Moreover, using technology as an assistive modality would reduce the demand of manpower, and provide higher treatment intensity with repeated training and objective performance feedback. Based upon our previous study finding from the physical activity with computerized upper limb training system (PACUTS), we propose to build a training strategy of physical activity for stroke wheelchair user in long-term care institution and to analyze its feasibility as well as the treatment effects, in the next two years.\n\nThe mixed method design will be applied. In the qualitative research, we will focus on the experience of physical activity training and subject's \"adoption and acceptance\" of the PACUTS. In terms of the quantitative research, 50 residents who currently live in long-term care institution will be recruited. Double-blinded randomized control-group pretest-posttest design will be conducted. In the experiment group, the participant will receive the intervention of PACUTS for 12 weeks/ 5 sessions per week/ 30 minutes, at least, per session. In terms of control group, the participant will receive a regular treatment program and physical activities scheduled by occupational therapist. This study is expected to contribute to build a training strategy with computerized upper limb training system which can helpfully promote the participation in physical activities and health outcomes for w/c residents living in long-term care institution.","detailedDescription":"In the past few years, the government has been focusing on community based care, the idea so-called aging-in-place. Therefore, the intervention model for residents in long-term care institution had been noticed by the researcher. Most of the residents in long-term care institution were wheelchair users, however, it would limit the participation in physical activities, and thus increase the degree of disability as they excessively rely on wheelchair. Recently, with the development of rehabilitation technology, the clients can receive more individualized physical activities intervention. Moreover, using technology as an assistive modality would reduce the demand of manpower, and provide higher treatment intensity with repeated training and objective performance feedback. Based upon our previous study finding from the physical activity with computerized upper limb training system (PACUTS), we propose to build a training strategy of physical activity for stroke wheelchair user in long-term care institution and to analyze its feasibility as well as the treatment effects, in the next two years.\n\nThe mixed method design will be applied. In the qualitative research, we will focus on the experience of physical activity training and subject's \"adoption and acceptance\" of the PACUTS. Through in-depth interview, field notes and different interviewers, the qualitative data analysis with phenomenology design will be applied. In terms of the quantitative research, 50 residents who currently live in long-term care institution will be recruited. Double-blinded randomized control-group pretest-posttest design will be conducted. In the experiment group, the participant will receive the intervention of PACUTS for 12 weeks/ 5 sessions per week/ 30 minutes, at least, per session. In terms of control group, the participant will receive a regular treatment program and physical activities scheduled by occupational therapist. Participants will be assessed by outcome measures, including Time Up and Go Test, Box and Block Test, Grip Strength Assessment, the Ruff 2 \\& 7 Selective Attention Test, System Usability Scale, Barthel Index, SF-36 and the Falls Efficacy Scale-International. Descriptive statistics, independent-sample t test, paired-sample t test or mixed type 2-way ANOVA will be performed for data analysis. This study is expected to contribute to build a training strategy with computerized upper limb training system which can helpfully promote the participation in physical activities and health outcomes for w/c residents living in long-term care institution."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"computer intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"stroke subjects with wheelchair users completed computer screen tasks with affected arm or bilateral arm movement","interventionNames":["Other: computer task intervention"]},{"label":"conventional long-term care services group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"stroke subjects with wheelchair users receive conventional long-term care services","interventionNames":["Other: conventional long-term care services"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"computer task intervention","description":"subject received programs for upper arm movement training with providing computer screen task activities","armGroupLabels":["computer intervention group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"conventional long-term care services","description":"stroke subjects with wheelchair users receive conventional long-term care services","armGroupLabels":["conventional long-term care services group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Box and Block Test","description":"The Box and Block Test (BBT) measures unilateral gross manual dexterity.
