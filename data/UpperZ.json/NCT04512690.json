Participants will undergo a surgical procedure to implant a system which provides epidural electrical stimulation (EES) of the cervical spinal cord. Researchers will quantify the ability of EES to recruit arm and hand muscles and produce distinct kinematic movements. The implant will be removed after less than 30 days. Results of this study will provide the foundation for future studies evaluating the efficacy of a minimally-invasive neuro-technology that can be used in clinical neurorehabilitation programs to restore upper limb motor function in people with subcortical strokes, thereby increasing independence and quality of life.","detailedDescription":"Specifically, researchers will 1) quantify the motor potentials in arm and hand muscles generated by single pulses of electrical stimulation of the spinal cord using FDA-cleared devices 2) characterize optimal stimulation parameter ranges to maximize induced arm and hand movement, 3) measure neural changes that could be induced by the system, 4) characterize potential clinical effects by assessing patient mobility, spasticity, and neurophysiology with standard clinical tests and simple motor tasks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Brain Diseases","Central Nervous System Diseases","Nervous System Diseases","Cardiovascular Diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Prospective, non-randomized, open-label, descriptive, experimental","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Epidural electrical stimulation of the cervical spinal cord","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Individuals with prior subcortical stroke and hemiparesis of the upper extremity.","interventionNames":["Device: Epidural electrical stimulation (EES) of the cervical spinal cord"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Epidural electrical stimulation (EES) of the cervical spinal cord","description":"All participants enrolled in this group will undergo a surgical procedure to implant a system which provides epidural electrical stimulation (EES) of the cervical spinal cord.
