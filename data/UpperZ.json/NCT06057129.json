The aims of this study are (1) to investigate the feasibility of unsupervised therapy with the ReHandyBot with stroke inpatients, first in a rehabilitation clinic and then at participants' home, (2) to evaluate the usability of the ReHandyBot (user interface, implemented exercises, and gaming environment, which were adapted for independent usage), and (3) to quantify the dose of additional robotic therapy that patients perform without supervision.\n\nThe study consists of two primary phases. The first is a familiarization phase performed at the clinic, where therapists teach to the participants how to perform the exercises with the robot. Then, if capable of training with the robot safely, after discharge from the clinic participants can bring the robot home and autonomously train with it. The hypothesis is that unsupervised therapy might be a possible way to increase therapy dose for stroke patients, with the potential to further improve recovery of hand function, with minimal additional burden for therapists and for the healthcare system."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Stroke","Hand impairment","Robot-assisted therapy","Unsupervised therapy","Neurorehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DEVICE_FEASIBILITY","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Unsupervised therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will perform therapy with the ReHandyBot first with the supervision of a therapist at the rehabilitation clinic.

Minimally-supervised therapy means that participants try to perform therapy with the device by themselves, while the supervisor is still present but helps only in case participants encounter problems or if they have any questions. During the supervised and minimally-supervised phases (first 2 weeks), the intervention dose is 5 sessions of approximately 45 minutes per week. These sessions are performed in addition to the conventional therapy plan. During each session, the robot proposes a set of 3 exercises, each lasting between 10 and 15 minutes.","armGroupLabels":["Unsupervised therapy"],"otherNames":["Familiarization phase"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Unsupervised therapy","description":"After the familiarization phase, participants train without supervision at the clinic until discharge and then at home for two weeks.\n\nIf the therapist thinks that the participant have properly learnt how to use the device and can train with it safely, the participant can keep training with the device unsupervised (both at the clinic and at home).\n\nIf participants are not ready for unsupervised therapy with the device, they receive a booklet of exercises to perform without supervision (both at the clinic and at home).
