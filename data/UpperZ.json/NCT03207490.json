Innovative approaches are needed in the next future, translating recent advances from neuro-engineering, into feasible devices for rehabilitation care. The FP7-EU project MYOSENS aims to translate known motor control logic from sEMG prosthetic control, to rehabilitation robotics. The target is to promote the closing of sensory-motor loop on the basis of intention to move, as detected from residual sEMG (i.e. Extensor Digitorum Communis, Flexor Digitorum Profundus).","detailedDescription":"The objectives of this pilot study are:\n\n* to assess whether a clinical and kinematic effect might be induced providing a closed-loop control by sEMG signal for robot (i.e. Amadeo Â®) assisted therapy of hand function\n* to determine safety and feasibility of including robotic therapy into daily rehabilitation programs after stroke.\n\nA total of 20 patients has been recruited, all of them received on daily basis 1 hour of robot therapy in adjunction to 1 hour of standard therapy. Overall the hour of robotic therapy include both subject preparation (15 minutes to place surface electrodes on the forearm and set the right position of sitting and upper limb) and delivery of exercises. The treatment protocol includes passive and active training of flexion and extension movements of the fingers. The passive part lasts 5 minutes, while the active one provides 25 total minutes divided into 5 exercises. The robot therapy lasts 15 consecutive sessions, 5 times a week, for 3 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["Hand","Rehabilitation","sEMG"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Intervention is provided by a robotic device for hand motion, controlled by closed loop surface electromyography (sEMG)","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robot group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Receive 1 hour of AMADEO (robot-assisted therapy) for the hand and 1 hour of daily standard rehabilitation therapy","interventionNames":["Device: AMADEO"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"AMADEO","description":"Robot therapy: 1-Degrees-Of-Freedom (1DOFs) robot training for flexion and extention movements of the hand.\n\nStandard rehabilitation therapy includes speech, physical, occupational therapies and group activities","armGroupLabels":["Robot group"],"otherNames":["Robot-assisted therapy for the hand"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change at Box and Block Test (BBT)","description":"Hand dexterity is measured by means of the BBT.
