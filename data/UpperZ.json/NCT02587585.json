Daily feedback on their activity levels may motivate stroke survivors to engage in greater skills practice and thus outcome after stroke. To date only a few trials suggests that augmented feedback may be effective. There is a need for a large pragmatic trial to explore the impact of augmented activity feedback on top of their standard care. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of augmented activity feedback by smart watches to support in-patient stroke rehabilitation.","detailedDescription":"This study had a feasibility and pilot development phase from September 2015 to April 2016, and then moved into the main study with some changes in design and execution occurring in the light of experience. Its execution has also been constrained by external factors beyond control.\n\nIt is in essence asking whether wearing a Smart Watch which gives feedback on activity every two hours, with a specific target tailored to the patient's performance 24 hours earlier will be associated with a higher rate of physical activity than seen in people wearing the same watch without and feedback been given.\n\nThe intervention only lasts unto 21 days, but earlier discharge will terminate that patient's participation sooner. A telephone interview at 12 weeks after entry collect data on mobility.\n\nOutcome measures will assess mobility, activity, and health status."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A randomised, parallel group, single-blinded, attention and feedback controlled study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"The patients wear identical watches; one gives no feedback on activity levels and one gives feedback on a two-hourly basis, with progress against a target derived from activity 24 hours earlier.","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Feedback against tailored target","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"For each two hour epoch, the watch calculate the level of activity for the same epoch the day before, and adds 5% as the new target to be achieved.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Feedback against tailored target"]},{"label":"No Feedback","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"For participants assigned to the control group, the smart watch will not provide any activity feedback against a target; it simply shows which two hour epoch a person is in.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: No feedback"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Feedback against tailored target","description":"Participants will wear a smart watch every weekday for nine hours during in-patient rehabilitation to monitor activity levels while receiving their usual care.
