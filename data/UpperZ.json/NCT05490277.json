It is designed to assess motor functioning, balance, sensation and joint functioning in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. It is applied clinically and in research to determine disease severity, describe motor recovery, and to plan and assess treatment. The scale is comprised of five domains and there are 155 items in total. Scoring is based on direct observation of performance. Scale items are scored on the basis of ability to complete the item using a 3-point ordinal scale where 0=cannot perform, 1=performs partially and 2=performs fully. The total possible scale score is 226.","timeFrame":"This clinical assessment will be done at baseline visit, three month visit, four month visit, seven month visit and eight month visit"},{"measure":"Neuro Quality of Life Upper Extremity Short Form test change from baseline, 3 months, 4 months, 7months and 8 months","description":"The Neuro quality of life upper extremity short form test measures the functionality of upper extremities. This is a self-report questionnaire that has a Likert scale from 1 to 5, with 5 indicating no difficulties and 1 indicating unable to do.

Functional categories may be scored from 0 to 1, 0 to 2, or 0 to 3, depending on the item. Total scores range from 0 to 20, with lower scores indicating increased disability","timeFrame":"This clinical assessment will be done at baseline visit, three month visit, four month visit, seven month visit and eight month visit"},{"measure":"Action Research Arm Test change from baseline, 3 months, 4 months, 7months and 8 months","description":"The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) is a 19 item observational measure used by physical therapists and other health care professionals to assess upper extremity performance (coordination, dexterity and functioning) in stroke recovery, brain injury and multiple sclerosis populations.Items comprising the ARAT are categorized into four subscales (grasp, grip, pinch and gross movement). Task performance is rated on a 4-point scale, ranging from 0 (no movement) to 3 (movement performed normally). Scores on the ARAT may range from 0-57 points, with a maximum score of 57 points indicating better performance.","timeFrame":"This clinical assessment will be done at baseline visit, three month visit, four month visit, seven month visit and eight month visit"},{"measure":"Timed Up and Go test change from baseline, 3 months, 4 months, 7months and 8 months","description":"This test is a measure walking ability with correlates to balance and fall risk. The patient is timed using a stopwatch and the patient is instructed to walk as quickly as possible for 3 meters.
