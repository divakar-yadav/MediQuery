In addition, it may cause pain and impaired hygiene, contractures, deformities etc. Spasticity has been reported in 30 to 90% of patients with stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) and cerebral palsy (CP).\n\nSpasticity therapy has emerged as an important approach to alleviate related symptoms. Positive effects on spasticity are well recognized following systemic and intra-thecal pharmacological treatment, as well as after intra-muscularly injected substances; the effect of the latter is, however, of limited duration. While pharmacological spasticity therapy has been applied for decades, surgical procedures remain fairly uncommon in adults with spasticity, but not in pediatric patients with CP, and outcomes after surgical treatment are scarcely described in the literature.\n\nThe study center is a specialized unit initially focused on reconstructive as well as spasticity reducing surgery in the upper extremities for SCI patients. Subsequently, patients with spasticity also due to various other Central nervous system diseases have been referred to the center for surgical treatment. Studies describing the effect of spasticity-reducing surgery in the upper extremities are rare and the group is heterogeneous. The aim of the study is therefore to evaluate the results and compare against todays golden standard treatment (boutuliniumtoxin injections)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spasticity, Muscle","Spinal Cord Injuries","Traumatic Brain Injury","Stroke","Upper Extremity Paresis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hand surgery and intensive rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The surgical treatment for reducing spasticity comprises lengthening of tendons, muscle release and occasionally correction of deformities. Lengthening of a tendon or releasing a muscle from its insertion, results in relaxation of the whole muscle-tendon unit. Hence, the spasticity is not gone, but reduced in strength.\n\nThe tendon lengthening procedures is performed by a stair-step incision technique followed by reattachment in the lengthened position using a side-to-side, cross-stich technique. The load to failure of the sutured tendon is approximately 200Newton, which gives a sufficient safety margin for early active mobilization of the tendons involved. This suture technique thus enables active training directly after surgery.\n\nPostoperative rehabilitation includes wrapping and a custom-made splint, for day and night use, muscle activation and passive stretching 2-4 times per day without the splint.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Hand surgery and intensive rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Botulinum toxin injections","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Botulinum toxin injections are given in spastic muscles of the upper extremity.
