The goal is to refine the device so that is more effective and easier for stroke patients to use to increase their hand function.","detailedDescription":"From previous experimentation with the MyHand device, the investigators have determined that the device can improve the grasping ability of stroke patients. The investigators now aim to make the controls more intuitive and accurate for the users, to enable subjects to grasp a wider array of objects, to make the donning and doffing of the device easier, and to continue to assess the MyHand as it helps subjects in functional tasks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Stroke","Rehabilitation","Hemiparesis","Robotics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MyHand Treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will use the MyHand device during repetitive grasp and release tasks.","interventionNames":["Device: MyHand Device"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"MyHand Device","description":"These subjects may be asked to attend 1-40 sessions (approximately 90 mins) to trial a variety of device controls and/or components.","armGroupLabels":["MyHand Treatment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Device Usability and Utility Questionnaire Score","description":"Subjects will provide feedback about their perceptions of the device's usability and utility for post-stroke upper extremity recovery.
