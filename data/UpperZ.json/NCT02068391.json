CSVD occurs six to ten times more often that an acute stroke. It is misleading to think, however, that CSVD is an inevitable part of \"getting old\" because people with CSVD are at high risk of developing an acute stroke or dementia. In fact, people with more CSVD lesion volume are more likely to develop day to day problems in planning, decision-making and speed of thinking. Unfortunately, there are no proven therapies designed to address CSVD. We propose to test whether aerobic exercise is an intervention that can combat CSVD because the disease is fundamentally a blood flow problem that may be improved by aerobic exercise. We will recruit CSVD adults with moderate to severe lesion burden and use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the brain in terms of structure, perfusion and function. Participants will be randomly assigned to either our established aerobic exercise program or a control stretching program. Both groups will take part in lab exercise sessions, which are designed to monitor progress and assess adherence to the program. The duration and intensity of their exercise will increase as participants progress. We will use activity log books, phone calls and extra \"booster\" exercise sessions, as needed, to maximize retention and adherence. We aim to show that aerobic exercise increases cerebral blood flow (CBF) in frontal-subcortical grey matter, supports regional tissue growth, and improves cognitive function in CSVD adults with substantial risk of acute stroke and dementia. A positive outcome of this research will provide strong support for additional clinical trials aimed at sustaining cognition and maintaining independent living."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases"],"keywords":["covert stroke","cerebral blood flow","grey matter","attention","executive function","aerobic exercise"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":39,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exercise","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will perform the 'Exercise Program' for months 0 to 6, and will be unsupervised for months 7 to 12.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Exercise Program"]},{"label":"Stretching","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will perform the 'Stretching Program' for months 0 to 6, and the 'Exercise Program' for months 7 to 12.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Stretching Program","Behavioral: Exercise Program"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Stretching Program","description":"The 'Stretching Program' will teach stretching for the upper and lower limbs, and the trunk, as well as breathing exercises for relaxation.
