The SF-36 is a generic non-preference based health status measure. This instrument assessed subject health across 8 variable dimensions, which are specific health domains such as physical functioning, social functioning and vitality. Each variable item score is coded and turned into a 0-100 scale where 0 indicates the worst and 100 indicates the best possible health state for both the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) of the questionnaire. Baseline results and the change from baseline to end of study/early withdrawal for the PCS and MCS are reported.","populationDescription":"The ITT population was defined as all enrolled subjects who received at least one injection of study medication in this open label extension study.

The EQ-5D-5L index is a generic preference based measure of health related QoL producing utility scores that represent subject preferences for particular health states. This instrument rated subject health state looking at 5 specific dimensions such as mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression and scored their general health state. Each dimension has 5 levels of severity (no problems, slight problems,moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems). In addition, a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100 was also included for the patients to summarize their overall health status, where 0 is the worst and 100 the best possible health state. The mean values for each dimension and the VAS scores at baseline and at the end of-study /early withdrawal are reported.","populationDescription":"The ITT population was defined as all enrolled subjects who received at least one injection of study medication in this open label extension study.
