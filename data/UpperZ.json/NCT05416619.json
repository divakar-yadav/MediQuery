The motor impairment of the hand is one of the most common sequelae in patients after stroke. Indeed, approximately 60% of patients with diagnosis of stroke suffers from hand sensorimotor impairment. In the last years, new approaches in neurorehabilitation field has been permitted to enhance hand motor recovery. Wearable devices permit to apply sensors to the patient's body for monitoring the kinematic and dynamic characteristics of patient's motion. Moreover, wearable sensors combined with electrodes detecting muscle activation (i.e. surface electromyography - sEMG) permit to provide biofeedback to the patient to improve motor recovery.","detailedDescription":"The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of using REMO® (Morecognition srl, Turin, Italy) device in hand motor rehabilitation.\n\nThe device REMO® is an armband composed by 8 bipolar electrodes able to record and process the electromyography of forearm muscles. The patterns of muscle activations are classified and used to perform sEMG-biofeedback exercises in stroke rehabilitation training. The device is developed by clinicians of IRCCS San Camillo Hospital and Morecognition Srl.\n\nA total of 20 patients with first diagnosis of stroke and with no other neurological diagnosis or severe cognitive impairment has been enrolled. The patients are tested with REMO® and if they are able to control at least one movements, they are enrolled in the longitudinal pilot study. The treatment consists in 15 sessions, 1hour/day, for 5 days/week, for 3 weeks. The patients are clinically evaluated before and after the REMO® treatment to define clinical effect of the sEMG-biofeedback training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Stroke, Ischemic","Stroke Hemorrhagic","Hemiparesis"],"keywords":["Neurological Rehabilitation","Hand Recovery","Electromyography"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Intervention is provided by a wearable device for hand rehabilitation.
