To adapt the sensors for the use by children with neurological disorders. The focus lies on the exact positioning and the investigation of the needed amount of IMUs.\n2. To validate the sensor data with collected video recordings and to develop specific algorithms to automatically extract specific movements and to analyze long-term sensor recordings.\n3. To perform a cross-sectional study to assess intensity, task-specificity and duration of upper and lower limb activity during rehabilitation. There, we aim to gain objective information about levels and types of activity during rehabilitation in relation to age, gender and disorder.\n4. To conduct a responsiveness study to assess whether or not the sensor output is able to highlight changes over time during rehabilitation.\n\nTherefore, at time point T=0 (shortly after admission to our center), participants are equipped with 3 inertial measurement units (1 at each wrist and 1 at the sternum). Additionally, a small wearable camera is mounted to the chest. The participants then return to their everyday life for 4 hours (no therapies, measurement period is in the evening). Afterwards, the equipment is removed again. To investigate responsiveness, the same protocol is being repeated 4 weeks later (time point T=1)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neurologic Disorders"],"keywords":["cerebral palsy","stroke","traumatic brain injury"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Inpatients"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Counts per minute at time point T=0","description":"From the wearable sensors at the wrist, a count/minute statistic is calculated that reflects the amount of activity the child performs during that time.","timeFrame":"At T=0"},{"measure":"Counts per minute at time point T=1","description":"From the wearable sensors at the wrist, a count/minute statistic is calculated that reflects the amount of activity the child performs during that time.","timeFrame":"At T=1 (4 weeks after T=0)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Motor assessment: Melbourne 2 at time point T=0","description":"The Melbourne Assessment 2: a test of unilateral upper limb function is a validated and reliable tool for evaluating quality of upper limb movement in children with neurological conditions aged 2.5 to 15 years.
