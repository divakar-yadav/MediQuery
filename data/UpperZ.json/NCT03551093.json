Screening (day 1)\n2. Implantation (day 1)\n3. Treatment and symptom assessment (days 1-5)\n4. Device Positioning and Removal (day 5)\n5. Discharge/Final Visit (day 7-10)\n\nOutcome Measures:\n\nPrimary Outcome Measures:\n\n1. The difference in NIHSS between baseline and Day 7 vs. Historical Controls\n2. % of patients with improvement in stroke symptoms (motor and/or sensory deficits) during stimulation\n\nAdditional Efficacy Outcome Measures:\n\n1. Existence of physiologic surrogates of the Personal Stimulation Level\n2. Improvement in stroke symptoms (motor and/or sensory deficits)\n\nSafety Outcome Measures:\n\n1. Comparative 7-day safety data between the ISS stimulation group of this study and of the ImpACT-24B study:\n\n   1. Incidence of Serious Adverse Events\n   2. Implantation Complications\n   3. Stimulation-related Adverse Events\n2. 7-day mortality\n3. Neurological deterioration\n4.
