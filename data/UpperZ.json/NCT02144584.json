Target enrollment will be 10 patients per group and adaptive randomization will be used to assist with equal representation of pre-stroke selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use and motor severity (Fugl-Meyer score) in each arm. The primary purpose of this pilot study is to measure adverse events, drop-out rates, feasibility of trial conductance, and establishment of effect sizes in each group in order to power a larger efficacy trial at the University of Utah.
