Hence, tACS with matching stimulation frequency could be an effective means of enhancing brain oscillatory activity to potentially induce synaptic plasticity for restoration of damaged brain functions. However from the existing studies of applying tACS over the M1 in healthy and diseased brains, there is a wide range of applied stimulation frequencies and varied neuromodulation effects on motor behavior or cortical excitability at different frequencies. In this proposal, subject-specific stimulation frequency and latency will be identified."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"subject-specific tACS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Constant current (1mA) will be applied for 20min at subject-specific stimulation frequency and latency","interventionNames":["Device: tACS"]},{"label":"standard tACS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Constant current (1mA) will be applied for 20min at 20Hz with a fixed 25ms latency","interventionNames":["Device: tACS"]},{"label":"Sham tACS","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"The stimulator will be shut down after 30s of stimulation.
