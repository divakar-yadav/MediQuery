However, when compared to traditional methods, recent randomized controlled trials conducted on larger participant groups failed to identify significant differences in motor-related outcomes between the two approaches.\n\nIn addition to motor deficits, stroke survivors often experience cognitive decline and sensory disturbances, which can significantly impede their recovery process. The introduction of multisensory stimulation and an enriched environment through robotic interventions may offer valuable supplementary treatments in these specific areas. Nevertheless, this aspect of treatment has not been thoroughly explored.\n\nThis study seeks to assess the effectiveness of upper limb robotic rehabilitation in individuals recovering from subacute strokes, in comparison to conventional treatments. Specifically, it aims to determine whether this robotic therapy can lead to improvements in (a) cognitive deficits, (b) somatosensory impairment, and (c) how these sensory and cognitive deficits influence the process of motor recovery.","detailedDescription":"The study aims to investigate whether an upper limb robotic treatment could have a greater impact than a conventional approach on specific cognitive domains in patients with stroke, as well as in restoring the somatosensory impairment in patients with stroke.\n\nFor this aim, 126 consecutive subjects with stroke in the sub-acute phase (within 6 months after stroke) will be enrolled and randomized to either the robotic (RG) or the conventional group (CG). The sample size was calculated by means of a 2- sided, 2-sample t-test assuming: 80% power; type I error of 0.05; a mean difference of 2.15 units on the MoCA, a common standard deviation of 3.77 points (Wu 2019). Considering a dropout rate of 20%, the final sample size required was estimated to be 126 subjects.\n\nRandomization will be stratified according to a cut-off of 18.28 on the MoCA demographically adjusted total score (inner confidence limit of the 5th centile of the normal population) indicating a borderline performance, to ensure that the subjects' characteristics in each group will be closely matched. In the RG, patients will undergo robotic therapy, while a conventional approach will be used in the CG. The rehabilitation treatments, either robotic or conventional, will be performed daily for 45 minutes, 5 days/week, for a total of 30 sessions. Patients in the RG will be treated using a set of devices that allow bi- and three-dimensional movements of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers (Aprile et al, 2019). Motor and cognitive tasks, carefully selected among those available, will be performed during the treatment, following a protocol already proposed in a previous pilot study (Aprile et al, 2021). Visual and auditory feedback will be provided to help the patients. In the RG, treatment will focus on reprogramming sensorimotor function, hypertonus inhibition, and functional improvement. Patients will be evaluated at baseline (T0), the end of the rehabilitation protocol (T1), and a 6-month follow-up (T2)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["robotics","cognition","rehabilitation","upper extremity","sensorimotor"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":126,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robotic Rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Robotic Rehabilitation of the upper limb"]},{"label":"Conventional treatment","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional Rehabilitation of the upper limb"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Robotic Rehabilitation of the upper limb","description":"Upper limb rehabilitation using a set of 4 devices.
