Thus the specific aim of the study was to develop a vibrotactile therapy system that can provide vibrotactile feedback through the pinch performance of the hand when countering mechanically induced perturbations and also analyzed training effects of the perturbation-based pinch task training system on the sensorimotor performance of the hands for stroke patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["stroke","perturbation-based training","task-specific motor training","recovery of function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Vibratory perturbed task-specific movement training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention: 10 minutes of traditional sensorimotor facilitation followed by 20 minutes of vibratory perturbed task-specific movement training","interventionNames":["Other: Vibratory perturbed task-specific movement training","Other: Sensorimotor training"]},{"label":"Traditional task-oriented facilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Intervention:10 minutes of traditional sensorimotor training followed by 20 minutes of reach-to-grasp and hand release training.","interventionNames":["Other: Traditional task-oriented facilitation","Other: Sensorimotor training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Vibratory perturbed task-specific movement training","description":"The perturbation-based pinch task training was conducted with the affected hand placed on the pinch device.
