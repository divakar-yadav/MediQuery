The Queen Square Upper Limb (QSUL) programme provides 90 hours of upper limb neurorehabilitation over 3-weeks to chronic stroke survivors. The recently published service evaluation demonstrated encouragingly large, clinically meaningful effects at the level of activity and body function. An alternative way to deliver high doses of effective therapy is through technological developments, e.g. immersive interactive gaming environments such as the MindPod Dolphin programme.\n\nThe intention of this study is to provide stronger level evidence for intensive upper limb rehabilitation by conducting a randomised controlled trial of two different types of upper limb training compared to usual care. Patients considered suitable for the QSUL programme will be randomised to either: Group 1- intensive upper limb rehabilitation programme (QSUL); Group 2- MindPod programme; Group 3-wait-list control (who will be offered the treatment after the waiting list is complete).\n\nThe first aim of the study is to compare the effect of each type of high-dose, high-intensity upper limb training to usual care using measures of upper limb impairment and activity levels 3 months after treatment is complete.\n\nThe secondary aims are to comply with recent recommended by the Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Roundtable, and (i) investigate the effects of upper limb neurorehabilitation on kinematics of upper limb movement (using a KINARM exoskeleton), and (ii) use neuroimaging (MRI and EEG) and neurophysiological (TMS) measures to determine the characteristics of stroke survivors who are most likely to benefit from this treatment approach.\n\nThe results from this work will (i) help determine the impact of two methods of high dose, high intensity upper limb training in chronic stroke patients; (ii) identify whether there are any predictors of treatment response that will help stratify patients in future clinical trials of upper limb neurorehabilitation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["upper limb","intensive training","motor impairment","kinematics","neurophysiology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":105,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Queen Square Upper limb training programme","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will undergo 45-60 hours of conventional physiotherapy and occupational therapy over 3 weeks as part of the Queen Square Upper Limb Neurorehabilitation Programme (QSUL) (Ward et al., 2019).","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Queen Square Upper Limb Neurorehabilitation Programme"]},{"label":"Mindpod Dolphin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will undergo 45-60 hours of arm, hand and finger training using immersive gaming technology (e.g. MindPod Dolphin) over 3 weeks.","interventionNames":["Device: Immersive gaming therapy"]},{"label":"Wait-list Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients will receive no planned treatment but will be on a waiting list for QSUL Programme after their follow up period if over."}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Queen Square Upper Limb Neurorehabilitation Programme","description":"A timetable will be implemented including a minimum of 45 hours of active time on task over 3 weeks 5-days a week (first and last day will involve the assessment procedures) (timetabled, 90-hours).
