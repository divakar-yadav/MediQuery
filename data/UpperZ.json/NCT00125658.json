In the present study we will conduct a double-blind, randomized clinical trial of staged rehabilitation for the upper-extremity involving sequential delivery of functional therapy and high intensity resistance training. Therefore, this proposal directly compares the effects of functional and resistance training delivered individually. The researchers' previous work investigated a hybrid therapy of functional and resistance training against functional training alone. All subjects will participate in a 5 week run-in period of no treatment. This no-treatment block will afford multiple baseline measurements and, in addition, will provide information regarding the rate and magnitude of any spontaneous recovery without treatment. Following the second baseline measurement, all subjects will be randomized to upper-extremity rehabilitation in either: Order A - 10 weeks of functional task practice training (FTP) followed by 10 weeks of high-intensity resistance training (Power) or Order B - resistance training (Power) followed by FTP. Re-evaluation will occur following each block of treatment,and retention effects will be evaluated after 6 and 12 months with no additional treatment. Subjects will be evaluated with: outcome measures used broadly in Clinical Neurology and Rehabilitation, a battery of biomechanical performance measures including: strength, muscle activation, reflex modulation, and motor coordination, and with kinematics of free reaching movements. The researchers will investigate persons in the intermediate phase of recovery which they define as between 6 and 18 months post-stroke , having completed all inpatient and outpatient therapies, with remaining residual motor deficits."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["biomechanics","Cerebrovascular Accident","electromyography","muscular weakness","recovery of function","reflex variability stroke","upper-extremity kinematics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":14,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"FTP: 30 sessions (90 minute sessions, 3 times per week, 10 weeks) followed by POWER: 30 sessions (90 minute sessions, 3 times per week, 10 weeks)","interventionNames":["Other: Control"]},{"label":"Experimental","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"POWER: 30 sessions (90 minute sessions, 3 times per week, 10 weeks) followed by FTP: 30 sessions (90 minute sessions, 3 times per week, 10 weeks)","interventionNames":["Other: Experimental"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control","description":"Following an initial testing session, you will complete a 5 week no training period.

As a performer practices and learns the movement, the number of sub movements is reduced. Sub movements can also present in persons with pathology. The unit of sub movements is whole numbers, or counts, of the sub movements. Data are change scores, expressed relative to baseline.","reportingStatus":"POSTED","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","unitOfMeasure":"sub movements","timeFrame":"baseline, 10 weeks, 20 weeks","groups":[{"id":"OG000","title":"Order A","description":"Participants randomized to Order A received 10 weeks of functional task practice (FTP) followed by 10 weeks of upper-extremity power training (Power).\n\nSingle, unilateral stroke, \\>6 \\<26 months post-event."},{"id":"OG001","title":"Order B","description":"Participants randomized to Order B received 10 weeks of upper-extremity Power Training followed by 10 weeks of functional task practice (FTP).\n\nSingle, unilateral stroke, \\>6 \\<26 months post-event."}],"denoms":[{"units":"Participants","counts":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6"}]}],"classes":[{"title":"Treatment effect (10 wks)","categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.71","spread":"4.43"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.79","spread":"1.38"}]}]},{"title":"Order effect (20 wks)","categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.64","spread":"10.81"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.71","spread":"2.40"}]}]}],"analyses":[{"groupIds":["OG000","OG001"],"groupDescription":"Tests for the effect of treatment (FTP vs. POWER) by comparing the change in movement smoothness between the end of treatment block 1 (10 weeks) and baseline.","nonInferiorityType":"SUPERIORITY_OR_OTHER","pValue":"0.085","statisticalMethod":"t-test, 2 sided"},{"groupIds":["OG000","OG001"],"groupDescription":"Tests for the effect of treatment order (OrderA (FTP before POWER) vs. OrderB (POWER before FTP)) by comparing the change in movement smoothness between the end of overall treatment (20 weeks) and baseline.","nonInferiorityType":"SUPERIORITY_OR_OTHER","pValue":"0.635","statisticalMethod":"t-test, 2 sided"}]}]},"adverseEventsModule":{"frequencyThreshold":"0","eventGroups":[{"id":"EG000","title":"Order A","description":"Participants randomized to Order A received 10 weeks of functional task practice (FTP) followed by 10 weeks of upper-extremity power training (Power).\n\nSingle, unilateral stroke, \\>6 \\<26 months post-event.","seriousNumAffected":0,"seriousNumAtRisk":8,"otherNumAffected":0,"otherNumAtRisk":8},{"id":"EG001","title":"Order B","description":"Participants randomized to Order B received 10 weeks of upper-extremity Power Training followed by 10 weeks of functional task practice (FTP).\n\nSingle, unilateral stroke, \\>6 \\<26 months post-event.","seriousNumAffected":0,"seriousNumAtRisk":6,"otherNumAffected":0,"otherNumAtRisk":6}]},"moreInfoModule":{"limitationsAndCaveats":{"description":"This was a small clinical trial (total n = 14)."},"certainAgreement":{"piSponsorEmployee":true},"pointOfContact":{"title":"Dr. Carolynn Patten","organization":"VA Brain Rehabilitation Research Center","email":"carolynn.patten@va.gov","phone":"352.376.1611","phoneExt":"4160"}}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-02-14"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"},{"id":"D000010291","term":"Paresis"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M21996","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Cerebrovascular Accident","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M20634","name":"Muscle Weakness","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4244","name":"Asthenia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12894","name":"Paresis","asFound":"Hemiparesis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5500","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4894","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5432","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17090","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12094","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":true}
