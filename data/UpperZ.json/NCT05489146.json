Despite intense rehabilitation, motor and functional recovery of patients with severe hand impairments is poor. Hence, there is a need for more effective treatments to enhance motor function in patients with severe hand impairments after stroke. Adaptive functional electrical stimulation (FES) appears to be a promising treatment and has the potential to facilitate active movement in individuals with severe impairments post-stroke. In addition, transcranial random noise stimulation (trns) is a widely studied, non-invasive and safe method to enhance the corticomotor excitability in individuals with chronic stroke. However, the effect of combining trns and adaptive FES in patients with severe hand impairments has not been investigated. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether combining trns with FES will enhance hand function in individuals with chronic stroke than FES alone. The investigators predict that combining trns with FES will significantly enhance hand function than FES alone.","detailedDescription":"The primary purpose of this study was to investigate whether combining transcranial random noise stimulation with functional electrical stimulation-facilitated task practice will enhance hand function in individuals with severe paresis post-stroke than functional electrical stimulation alone.\n\nThe study is an experimental randomized study comparing the effects of transcranial random noise stimulation with functional electrical stimulation to functional electrical stimulation alone on recovery of function in the more-affected hand in individuals with chronic stroke.\n\nParticipants were randomized to receive transcranial random noise stimulation and functional electrical stimulation-facilitated task practice or sham-transcranial random noise stimulation and functional electrical stimulation-facilitated task practice.\n\nParticipants received 18 treatment sessions over 6 weeks (3 times/week for 6 weeks)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["stroke","hand","brain stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"The participant, outcome assessor, investigator, and therapist providing the intervention were blinded.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":14,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"tRNS and FES facilitated task practice","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"In this arm, participants received real transcranial random noise stimulation with FES facilitated task practice","interventionNames":["Device: transcranial random noise stimulation and functional electrical stimulation facilitated task practice"]},{"label":"sham tRNS and FES facilitated task practice","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"In this arm, participants received sham transcranial random noise stimulation with FES facilitated task practice","interventionNames":["Device: transcranial random noise stimulation and functional electrical stimulation facilitated task practice"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"transcranial random noise stimulation and functional electrical stimulation facilitated task practice","description":"Participants were randomized to one of the two intervention groups \\[transcranial current stimulation (tRNS) and functional electrical stimulation (FES) or FES with sham tRNS\\] before pre-intervention testing.
