Half of the participants will receive robot-assisted therapy for the arm affected by stroke, and the other half will receive robot-assisted therapy plus training in how to use the weaker arm during every day activities.","detailedDescription":"Research has shown that robot-assisted therapy can help people regain control of simple reaching or grasping movements, but these improvements don't generalize well to use of the weaker limb during everyday tasks.\n\nThis study aims to refine and test a protocol named the Active Learning Program for Stroke (ALPS), which teaches people to use active problem solving strategies and a home program to improve function. Therapist-delivered ALPS instruction may incorporate use of strategies (e.g. STOP, THINK, DO, CHECK) modeled after the Cognitive Orientation for daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP) approach to improve real-world use of the paretic upper limb. We will evaluate whether the combination of robot-assisted therapy and ALPS training leads to better satisfaction and functional use of the weaker arm in persons with motor impairments more than 6 months after stroke, as compared to robot-assisted therapy alone."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Cerebrovascular Accident"],"keywords":["Upper limb function","Arm and hand weakness"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Evaluator(s) will be blinded to assigned study group and intervention.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robot-Assisted Therapy (RT)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Armeo \\& Amadeo robot-assisted intensive upper limb therapy 1 hour sessions 3x week for 6 weeks.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Robot-Assisted Therapy (RT)"]},{"label":"Robot + Active Learning Program(RT-ALPS)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Armeo \\& Amadeo robot-assisted intensive upper limb therapy 1 hour sessions 3x week for 6 weeks plus training in active problem solving, analysis of performance, and goal-setting focused on the transfer of acquired motor skills to daily activities in the home and community.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Robot + Active Learning Program(RT-ALPS)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Robot-Assisted Therapy (RT)","description":"Highly intensive robot-assisted therapy for the paretic arm with the Armeo exoskeleton (1 hour sessions, 3x week for 3 weeks) followed by robot-assisted therapy for hand motions with Amadeo robot (3x week for 3 weeks).","armGroupLabels":["Robot-Assisted Therapy (RT)"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Robot + Active Learning Program(RT-ALPS)","description":"Highly intensive robot-assisted therapy for the paretic arm with the Armeo exoskeleton (1 hour sessions, 3x week for 3 weeks) followed by robot-assisted therapy for hand motions with Amadeo robot (3x week for 3 weeks).
