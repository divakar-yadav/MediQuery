Following perinatal stroke, approximately 60% of children develop cerebral palsy (usually presenting as spastic hemiplegia), 30-60% experience epilepsy, 25% show language delay, and up to 22% manifest behavioral problems.\n\nThe current most predictive tools for early diagnosis of CP are a combination of brain MRI/cUS and a general movements (GM) assessment in the fidgety period (9). Asymmetry of fidgety GMs around 12 weeks post term can be the first clinical signs of hemiplegia.\n\nThere are currently two intensive therapy approaches aiming at improving upper limb performance in adults and children (average age 8 years) with established hemiplegic CP: constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) and Hand-arm bimanual intensive training (HABIT). Those current therapy approaches fundamentally comprise repeated practice of desired movements based on motor learning principles with the adult/ child as an active participant.\n\nBoth therapies, in adults and in children with established hemiplegic CP (average age 8 years) are effective and show similar improvements if the dosage of therapy is similar. In contrast, the feasibility and the effects of both therapy approaches at very young age (under age 1 year) is still unknown (22). Exploring these options to treat even before asymmetric hand use has appeared is interesting and promising enough since recent animal studies have demonstrated that there is a critical period of motor system plasticity, and that activity-dependent reorganization of the motor-projection pattern to the hand occurs before about 1 year of age"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"],"keywords":["early intervention, infant"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CIMT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A soft splint or restraint will be posed to best functioning hand of the infant only during the therapy session.
