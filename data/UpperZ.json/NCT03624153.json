The study was conducted using a randomized, two-period crossover design. Participants were randomly assigned to group 1 or group 2 using a computer-generated list. Participants in group 1 received 12 sessions of robot-assisted intervention first, followed by a one-month washout period, and then received 12 sessions of conventional intervention. Participants in group 2 received 12 sessions of conventional intervention first, followed by a one-month washout period, and then received 12 sessions of robot-assisted intervention. Outcome measures were performed before the intervention, after the first 12-session intervention, and after the second 12-session intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":31,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robotic-assisted intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"70 minutes Robotic-assisted intervention.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Robotic-assisted intervention"]},{"label":"Conventional intervention","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"70 minutes conventional rehabilitation.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Conventional rehabilitation intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Robotic-assisted intervention","description":"Participants received the 12-session robot-assisted intervention 3 sessions a week for 4 consecutive weeks.

The WMFT contains 15 function-based tasks and 2 strength-based tasks. The time (WMFT-time) and the functional ability (WMFT-quality) for an individual to complete the tasks will be recorded. A shorter WMFT-time and a larger WMFT-quality score indicate a faster movement and better quality of movement, respectively.","timeFrame":"Baseline, after completing the first 12-session intervention sessions (around 4 weeks after baseline); after completing the second 12-session intervention sessions (around 12 weeks after baseline"},{"measure":"Change scores of Motor Activity Log (MAL)","description":"The MAL will be used to assess the amount of use (AOU) and quality of movement (QOM) of the paretic UE.
