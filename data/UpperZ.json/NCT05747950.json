Stroke ranks third among the causes of death and first in terms of disability. Spasticity, a velocity-dependent increase in muscle tone as a part of upper motor neuron syndrome, is seen in a wide variety of neurological diseases, including stroke, and may occur in the first week after stroke.Rehabilitation aims to inhibit spasticity, improve motor functions, gain independence in activities of daily living, and improve health-related quality of life in stroke patients.This is an observational study within a study.This study was carried out in Kırıkkale University Faculty of Medicine, Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Hospital and Tokat State Hospital Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Unit 45 volunteers who were diagnosed with stroke, aged 18-75 years, who met the inclusion criteria of the study planned for the individual.In the study, patients were divided into 3 groups according to different treatment methods the effects of Local Vibration and m(CIMT) applied to upper extremity flexor muscle groups on spasticity and upper extremity functionality will be examined in addition to the conventional rehabilitation program in stroke individuals. A program that includes joint range of motion exercises, strengthening exercises, mobility and transfer activities and various activities to increase participation in daily life activities will be applied routinely for 3 sessions 45 minutes a week for 8 weeks in the first group of patients in the training group.In addition, in addition to conventional physiotherapy, patients in the 1st group immediately after the sessions. Upper extremity flexor on the hemiplegic side in supine position, 3 sessions per week with a CE certified vibration device with a frequency of 50-110 Hz and an amplitude of 1-4 mm.Vibration will be done for 15 minutes each.From the patients in the second group, for 8 weeks, 3 days a week, 60 minutes joint range of motion exercises as routine conventional treatment in sessions,strengthening exercises, mobility and transfer activities, and activities of daily living.In order to increase participation, a program including various activities will be implemented. Moreover after the sessions, patients can use their intact extremities with shoulder stabilization orthosis at home restraint, grasping on the hemiplegic side, using spoons and forks, combing hair daily life activities, 8 weeks, 3 days a week, and approximately 3 hours Modified Restrictor Forced Movement Therapy m(CIMT) will be applied.In the third group, the last group in the third group, for 8 weeks, 3 days a week, 60 minutes joint range of motion exercises as routine conventional treatment only in sessions, strengthening exercises, mobility and transfer activities, and activities of daily living. In order to increase participation, a program including various activities will be implemented.\n\nFirst of all, all individuals; Demographic characteristics such as age, gender, height, weight, case report form will be questioned.

Although it is not as widely used as MAS, it is recommended as a more effective method in the evaluation of spasticity because it measures resistance to passive movement at two different rates. While performing MTS, the extremities are moved passively with V1, V2 and V3 velocities. V1 speed; as slow as possible (slower than the gravity fall velocity of the limb segment), V2 velocity is defined as the extremity fall velocity, and V3 velocity is defined as as fast as possible (faster than the normal gravity fall velocity of the limb). In MTS, V1 velocity can be used to measure passive range of motion, and V2 or V3 velocities can be used to measure spasticity.","timeFrame":"Change in Upper Extremity Spasticity at 8 Weeks,Two measurements before and after treatment, 1 minute"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Rating Scale","description":"It is a performance-based scale specific to hemiplegia, and each parameter is scored as 0: unsuccessful, 1: partially successful, 2: completely successful performance.

When evaluating the wrist, three different functions of the wrist muscles are evaluated in the shoulder, elbow and forearm. In the hemiplegia hand evaluation, 7 movements (flexion, extension and five grip functions) are evaluated. In the evaluation of coordination / speed, finger-nose test is performed for the upper extremity. During this test, tremor, dysmetria, and speed of movement are evaluated.

NHPT is applied with the patient in a sitting position. The patient is asked to line up the nine sticks in the box on the table as quickly as possible into the holes of the other box and, after finishing, remove them immediately. The test is started with the dominant hand, the time is measured with a stopwatch, and it is started when the hand touches the bars and ends when the last stick is placed in the box.","timeFrame":"Change in Upper Extremity Functionality at 8 Weeks,Two measurements before and after treatment, 4 minutes"},{"measure":"Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale","description":"In 1999, Williams et al.

For the test, the patient is told to throw the wooden blocks in one section into the other section as quickly as possible and 60 seconds are given. The test is applied to both the dominant and non-dominant hand and the number of wooden blocks thrown to the opposite side gives the total score.
