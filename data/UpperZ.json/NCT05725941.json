The rehabilitation process for upper extremity for individuals with stroke is of long duration and clinicians face the challenge of identifying a variety of assistive appliances that may be adapted and graded to facilitate this process. One of these appliances that is widely used in rehabilitation is splint and strapping. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effectiveness of this modality in rehabilitation of the upper limb in stroke survivors.","detailedDescription":"Stroke often results in spasticity and associated motor impairments in the upper limb Spasticity in the upper limb commonly interferes with its motor activities, and results in impairments in the upper limb muscles. Persistent upper limb impairments can lead to limitations in activities of daily living, and quality of life. Assistive devices to facilitate the use of the hemiplegic upper extremity are considered to be the most important modalities in improving the functions of the upper limb. The splint is one of the most assistive tools in the rehabilitation of such individuals. The supportive and corrective functions provided by upper limb and hand splints have been shown to inhibit spasticity and promote the capabilities of the upper limb in individuals with stroke This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of spiral strapping on inhibition of spasticity and improving upper limb functions in individuals with chronic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Splints","Physical Disability"],"keywords":["Stroke","Upper Limb Functions","Spiral Strapping"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Individuals who will participate in the control group will receive a traditional functional exercise training protocol (conventional physiotherapy program) for one hour.

It assesses a patient's ability to handle objects differing in size, weight and shape and therefore can be considered to be an arm-specific measure of activity limitation. The ARAT consists of 19 items grouped into four subscales: grasp, grip, pinch, and gross movement. The ARAT is scored on a four-level ordinal scale (0-3): 0 = cannot perform any part of the test, 1 = performs partially, 2 = take long time to complete the test, and 3 = performs the test normally. The total score on the ARAT ranges from 0 to 57, with the lowest score indicating that no movements can be performed, and the upper score indicating normal performance. Thus, the higher the score a patient get after completion of the treatment program compared to the baseline score, the better the improvement in upper extremity motor functions.","timeFrame":"[Data was collected at baseline, and 4weeks after intervention commencement.] (i.e. Difference between The Action Research Arm Test Score at both baseline and completion of 4 weeks of intervention)"},{"measure":"Change in the Modified Ashworth Scale (scale that assess the change in muscle tone)","description":"Modified Ashworth Scale was used to evaluate the degree of spasticity in the involved upper limb in the elbow and wrist joints.
