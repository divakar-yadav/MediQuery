Visits will consist of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) assessment during the child's natural sleep, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), and Motor Behavioral Assessments.","detailedDescription":"Perinatal stroke has disabling consequences; 50-75% of individuals will develop life-long motor impairment, and 10-60% will also have cognitive deficits. These deficits lead to challenges in the school and home environments, with decreased likelihood of employment and independence and increased caregiver burden. Additionally, perinatal stroke is one of the primary causes of cerebral palsy (CP), a chronic and disabling neurological condition affecting motor function.\n\nThe first two years of life constitute a critical period of brain development and heightened neuroplasticity. There is now a consensus that, due to brain plasticity and rapid development, providing an early intervention may result in optimal recovery and lower costs of care. Unfortunately, researchers still have only limited understanding of how the brain develops after perinatal stroke and as a result CP diagnoses are typically not made until two years of age. There is an urgent need for very early diagnosis, prognosis and understanding of mechanisms in order to develop novel early interventions to improve outcomes in perinatal stroke with resultant CP.\n\nIntegrating study team's experience in studying and caring for this vulnerable infant stroke population, they propose to use non-invasive brain stimulation, neuroimaging, and behavioral assessments to analyze associations between development patterns, especially in the CST, and potential diagnosis of CP.\n\nSpecific aims of this study are:\n\n* Aim 1. Map the presence and excitability of corticospinal pathways.\n* Aim 2. Map the structural integrity and connectivity of corticospinal pathways.\n* Aim 3. Compare motor outcomes from clinical behavioral assessments against corticospinal tract excitability and integrity.\n* Aim 4. Identify the association between brain white-matter connectivity and general movements.\n* Aim 5. Identify the association between corticospinal circuitry and general movements.\n\nProtocol Amendment approved on 10/22/2021 removes TMS intervention and outcomes, adds a study time point at 0-2 months, and lowers the eligibility age to term.\n\nProtocol Amendment approved on 12/21/2021 adds the TMS intervention back."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Perinatal Stroke"],"keywords":["Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)","Brain Reorganization","Brain Lesions","perinatal stroke","neonatal hemorrhagic stroke","neonatal thrombotic stroke","neonatal intracranial hemorrhage","neonatal periventricular leukomalacia","hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy","neonatal brain bleed","early brain injury"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":65,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Infants","description":"Pre-term and term born infants with corrected gestational age between term age and 24 months with radiologically-confirmed acute unilateral or bilateral brain lesions, including perinatal stroke, neonatal hemorrhagic or thrombotic stroke, involving the motor cortex and/or subcortical structures, and intracranial hemorrhage, involving the motor cortex and/or subcortical white matter, or periventricular leukomalacia.
