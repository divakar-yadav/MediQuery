However, it is not clear which group of patients are suitable for EMG driven exoskeletons use and there has not been any established treatment protocol.\n\nThe aims of the study are 1- to investigate the effectiveness of the EMG-driven exoskeleton for hand rehabilitation in patients with acute stroke. 2- to understand which group of the patients may give the best response to the EMG-driven technology and how should be the treatment protocol designed.","detailedDescription":"Improving the rehabilitation outcome of the upper extremity in stroke patients has been an ongoing challenge in the rehabilitation field. Up to 85% of stroke survivors experience a certain degree of paresis of the upper limb at the onset and only 20% to 56% of survivors regain complete functional use of the affected upper limb despite the therapeutic interventions in first 3 months . Recovery of upper limb function is generally slower and non-complete.\n\nTo support and speed up a recovery process, there are many robotic devices currently used in the stroke units. Unlike one-on-one treatment applied by clinicans, robotic devices can provide repetitive, task oriented movements,with greater intensity, stimulating and engaging environment for user, hence alleviating the labour-intensive aspects of hands-on conventional therapy. There are a number of complex robotic devices that have been developed over the last two decades to assist upper arm training in rehabilitation.\n\nUsing EMG driven exoskeleton, commercially known as the Hand of Hope (HOH), has been shown its efficacy to improve patient's grip and pinch ability, muscle coordination and improve functional daily living tasks in patients even after 3,4,8,10 and 14 years after onset of the stroke. In addition to continuous investigation efforts needed to be spent, there has not been established any treatment protocol using EMG-driven exoskeletons. Since Stroke patients need to be focused on their own residual muscle power, clear indications for EMG-driven exoskeletons i.e., Hand of Hope, need to be established.\n\nAn investigation designed to highlight all these points will make an important contribution to the therapeutic approach using EMG-driven hand robotics for the hand rehabilitation after stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Stroke"],"keywords":["EMG driven exoskeleton","hand rehabilitation","hand function","upper extremity outcome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Robotic rehabilitation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Active Comparator: Robotic rehabilitation\n\nProtocol with EMG-driven hand exoskeleton (Hand of Hope):\n\nWarm-up: 10 min passive mode 2 min resting\n\nTraining: According to residual muscle power:\n\n* 10 min active-assistive, 2 min resting, 10 min Active-assistive or\n* 5 min active, 2 min resting, 15 min active assistive or\n* 10 min active, 2 min resting, 10 min active and\n* 10 min window cleaning game Robotic rehabilitation will be applied 5 times a week; Totally 15 sessions (3 weeks).
