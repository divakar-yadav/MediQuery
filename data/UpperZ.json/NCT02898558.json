In a recent study we have tested if motor abilities of patients with stroke improve wearing magnifying lenses, showing that a beneficial effect of magnifying lenses can be observed in some patients. In the present study, we will identify 12 patients from this cohort who demonstrated an improvement greater than 10% in one or two motor task when wearing magnifying glasses. These participants will be invited to take part in a clinical study in which they will undergo a training phase: subjects will wear magnifying lenses at home for 30 minutes daily for 14 days while completing a jigsaw puzzle; a log will be kept to document participation. Participants' performance on different motor tasks will be assessed before, immediately after and 1 month after the training session. Standardized measures of motor performance will include the the Action Research Arm test and the Rivermead Assessment of Somatosensory Performance (RASP). In addition, participants will undergo grip strength, finger tapping tasks and a reaching and grasping task. We expect the repeated use of magnifying lenses to generate an improvement of patients' performance across tasks and this effect to be persistent in time.","detailedDescription":"Altering the apparent size of a body part with magnifying changes tactile acuity, tactile distance judgments and pain perception.\n\nIn a recent study we have tested if motor abilities (grip strength, finger tapping and reaching and grasping) of patients with stroke improve wearing magnifying lenses. The results of this study showed that a beneficial effect of magnifying lenses on movement can be observed in some patients with stroke. The present study aims at following up these results and investigating the possible use of magnifying lenses in the rehabilitation to improve motor controls of stroke patients.\n\nTo pursuit this aim, we will identify 12 patients in our previous study cohort who demonstrated an improvement greater than 10% in the grip strength or finger tapping task when wearing magnifying glasses. These participants will be invited to take part in the present clinical study in which they will undergo a training phase: subjects will wear magnifying lenses at home for 30 minutes daily for 14 days while completing a jigsaw puzzle; a log will be kept to document participation. Participants' performance on different motor tasks will be assessed before, immediately after and 1 month after the training session. Standardized measures of motor performance will include the the Action Research Arm test and the Rivermead Assessment of Somatosensory Performance (RASP). In addition, participants will undergo grip strength (6 trials), finger tapping tasks (6 trials) and a reaching and grasping task, inn which they will be asked to reach and grasp 3 different objects (30 trials). We expect the repeated use of magnifying lenses to generate an improvement of patients' performance across task and this effect to be persistent in time."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":25,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Magnification hand size","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"magnifying lenses used for 30 minutes daily for 14 days while completing a jigsaw puzzle","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Magnification hand size","Device: magnifying lenses"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Magnification hand size","description":"Participants will use magnifying lenses while completing a jigsaw puzzle for 30 min a day for 14 days.","armGroupLabels":["Magnification hand size"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"magnifying lenses","armGroupLabels":["Magnification hand size"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Action Research Arm test","description":"19 item measure of motor control (i.e. (grasp, grip, pinch, and gross arm movement).
