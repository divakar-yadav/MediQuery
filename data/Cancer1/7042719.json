SAR405838 is found to be a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which limits its distribution to the brain. Based on the findings in the paper, manipulation of the function of P-gp can significantly increase the brain exposure of SAR405838, which may give an insight on its potential benefit as a treatment for primary and metastatic brain cancer.",
