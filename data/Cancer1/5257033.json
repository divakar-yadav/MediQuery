    "title": "Increased Nanoparticle Delivery to Brain Tumors by Autocatalytic Priming for Improved Treatment and Imaging",
    "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is partially disrupted in brain tumors. Despite the gaps in the BBB, \nthere is an inadequate amount of pharmacological agents delivered into the brain. Thus, the low \ndelivery efficiency renders many of these agents ineffective in treating brain cancer. In this report, \nwe proposed an \u201cautocatalytic\u201d approach for increasing the transport of nanoparticles into the \nbrain. In this strategy, a small number of nanoparticles enter into the brain via transcytosis or \nthrough the BBB gaps. After penetrating the BBB, the nanoparticles release BBB modulators that \nenables more nanoparticles to be transported, creating a positive feedback loop for increased \ndelivery. Specifically, we demonstrated that these autocatalytic brain tumor-targeting poly(amine-\nco-ester) terpolymer nanoparticles (ABTT NPs) can readily cross the BBB and preferentially \naccumulate in brain tumors at a concentration of 4.3- and 94.0-fold greater than that in the liver \nand in brain regions without tumors, respectively. We further demonstrated that ABTT NPs were \ncapable of mediating brain cancer gene therapy and chemotherapy. Our results suggest ABTT NPs \n*Correspondence: Jiangbing Zhou, 310 Cedar Street, FMB 410, New Haven, CT 06510, Tel: 203-785-5327, iiangbing.zhou@vale.edu. \nSupporting Results, Materials and Methods.
