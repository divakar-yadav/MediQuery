    "title": "Towards controlled drug delivery in brain tumors with microbubble-enhanced focused ultrasound",
    "abstract": "Brain tumors are particularly challenging malignancies, due to their location in a structurally and \nfunctionally distinct part of the human body \u2013 the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS is \nseparated and protected by a unique system of brain and blood vessel cells which together prevent \nmost bloodborne therapeutics from entering the brain tumor microenvironment (TME). Recently, \ngreat strides have been made through microbubble (MB) ultrasound contrast agents in conjunction \nwith ultrasound energy to locally increase the permeability of brain vessels and modulate the brain \nTME. As we elaborate in this review, this physical method can effectively deliver a wide range \nof anticancer agents, including chemotherapeutics, antibodies, and nanoparticle drug conjugates \nacross a range of preclinical brain tumors, including high grade glioma (glioblastoma), diffuse \nintrinsic pontine gliomas, and brain metastasis. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that this \ntechnology can promote the effective delivery of novel immunotherapeutic agents, including, \nimmune check-point inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T cells, among others. With early \nclinical studies demonstrating safety and several Phase I/II trials testing the preclinical findings \nunderway this technology is making firm steps towards shaping the future treatments of primary \nand metastatic brain cancer. By elaborating on its key components, including ultrasound systems \nPublisher's Disclaimer: This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.
