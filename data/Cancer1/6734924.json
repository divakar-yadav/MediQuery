    "abstract": "The gut-brain axis formed by blood and lymphatic vessels paves the way for microbiota to impact \nthe brain. Bacterial populations in the gut are a good candidate for a nongenetic factor contributing \nsubstantively to brain tumor development and to the success of therapy. Specifically, suppression \nof the immune system and induction of inflammation by microbiota sustain proliferative signaling, \nlimit cell death, and induce angiogenesis as well as invasiveness. In addition, altered microbial \nmetabolites and their levels could stimulate cell proliferation. We propose here a novel gear model \nconnecting these complex interdisciplinary fields. Our model may impact mechanistic studies of \nbrain cancer and better treatment outcomes through precision oncology.\nThe Complex Role of Genetics, Immune State, and Microbiome in Brain \nCancer Development\nTumors of the central nervous system (CNS) represent a major source of cancer-related \ndeaths in adults and in children [1]. Studies of the molecular etiology of these devastating \ndiseases have elucidated various genetic alterations involving cell survival and DNA repair \npathways [2]. Rational targeted therapy to these pathways was not effective or showed only \nvery mild improvement in survival [3]. In addition to tumor heterogeneity being a major \nobstacle to finding a common and effective treatment, during brain neoplasia there is a \nprocess of immune suppression, providing an environment that favors tumor growth [4\u20137]. \nWhile immunotherapy efforts are under way to disrupt these mechanisms and to turn the \nimmune system against developing tumors [8], understanding how the immune suppression \nis initiated is a crucial step toward inhibiting tumorigenesis. We review here the possible \nimpact of the gut\u2013brain axis on the immune system state, inflammation, tumorigenicity, and \nresponse to treatment. Precision medicine taking into account the microbiome\u2019s impact on \nimmune suppression and treatment response would result in immune response activation and \nbetter response to treatment and would increase patient survival.\n*Correspondence: ruty.shai@sheba.health.gov.il (R.
