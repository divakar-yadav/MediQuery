    "abstract": "Nanomedicine is a rapidly evolving form of therapy that holds a great promise in superior drug \ndelivery efficiency and therapeutic efficacy than conventional cancer treatment. In this review, we \nattempt to cover the benefits and the limitations of current nanomedicines with special attention to \ncovalent nanoconjugates for imaging and drug delivery in brain. The improvement in brain tumor \ntreatment remains dismal despite decades of efforts in drug development and patient care. One of \nthe major obstacles in brain cancer treatment is the poor drug delivery efficiency owing to the \nunique blood-brain-barrier (BBB) in the CNS. Although various anti-cancer agents are available to \ntreat tumors outside of the CNS, the majority fails to cross the BBB. In this regard, nanomedicines \nhave increasingly drawn attention due to their multi-functionality and versatility. Nano-drugs can \npenetrate BBB and other biological barriers, and selectively accumulate in tumor cells, while \nconcurrently decreasing systemic toxicity.\nGraphical abstract\nCorresponding Author: Julia Y.
