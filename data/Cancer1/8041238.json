    "title": "Salting the soil: Targeting the microenvironment of brain metastases",
    "abstract": "Paget\u2019s \u2018seed and soil\u2019 hypothesis of metastatic spread has acted as a foundation of the field for \nover a century, with continued evolution as mechanisms of the process have been elucidated. The \nCNS presents a unique soil through this lens, relatively isolated from peripheral circulation and \nimmune surveillance with distinct cellular and structural composition. Research in primary and \nmetastatic brain tumors has demonstrated that this tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an \nessential role in the growth of CNS tumors. In each case, the cancerous cells develop complex and \nbi-directional relationships that reorganize the local TME and reprogram the CNS cells, including \nendothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes, microglia, infiltrating monocytes, and lymphocytes. These \ninteractions create a structurally and immunologically permissive TME with malignant processes \npromoting positive feedback loops and systemic consequences. Strategies to interrupt interactions \nwith the native CNS components, on 'salting the soil,' to create an inhospitable environment are \npromising in the preclinical setting. This review aims to examine the general and specific \npathways thus far investigated in BrM and related work in glioma to identify targetable \nmechanisms that may have general application across the spectrum of intracranial tumors.\nKeywords\nmicroenvironment; brain metastasis; immune suppression; therapeutic targets\nCorresponding Author: Mustafa Khasraw MD, Duke University Medical Center; Duke University \u2223 Box 3624, Durham, NC 27710, \nmustafa.khasraw@duke.edu Phone: +1 919.684.6173. \nAuthor\u2019s Financial Disclosures and conflicts:\nESS declares no conflicts; ACT declares no conflicts; CKA: Research funding PUMA, Lilly, Merck, Seattle Genetics, Nektar, Tesaro, \nG1-Therapeutics; Compensated consultant role: Genentech, Eisai, IPSEN, Seattle Genetics; Astra Zeneca; Royalties: UpToDate, Jones \nand Bartlett; Ann Marie Pendergast: The Pew Biomedical Program Advisory Committee; DAS: none declared; DMA: stock and other \nownership interests in Diverse Biotech; consulting or advisory positions for Istari Oncology and Jackson Laboratory for Genomic \nMedicine; patents, royalties, other intellectual property for \u201cMethods for predicting tumor response to immunotherapy, U.S. \nProvisional application no. 62/787\u201d and \u201cMethods for predicting tumor response to immunotherapy, U.S. Provisional application no. \n62/620,577\u201d; and expert testimony for Tanoury, Nauts, McKinney & Gabarino, PLLC; PEF reports consulting for Monteris Medical; \nM.K. reports consultant or advisory roles for Janssen, AbbVie, Ipsen, Pfizer Roche, and Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine; \nresearch funding from AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), and Specialized Therapeutics.\nHHS Public Access\nAuthor manuscript\nMol Cancer Ther.
