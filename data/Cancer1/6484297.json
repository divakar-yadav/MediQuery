    "description": "1\n      INTRODUCTION\n      A previous study reported that brain cancer is one of the most invasive and malignant cancers in developed countries.1 However, the chemotherapy for brain cancer remains obscure. Two of the best strategies for tumour suppression are the induction of apoptosis (type I cell death) and cell cycle arrest in cancer cells.2 Recent studies have demonstrated that phytochemicals synthesized from plants can suppress tumour growth by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and down\u2010regulating gap junctional intercellular communication.3, 4, 5\n\n      Cucurbitacins, a class of tetracyclic triterpenoids with medicinal properties in Cucurbitaceae, are extracted from the climbing stems of Cucumis melo L.6 Cucurbitacins have been widely used in inhibition of cancer cell progression as medicinal herbs throughout Asia.7 In recent years, there is a growing interest in this herb because of its presumed beneficial pharmacological properties as anti\u2010inflammatory8 and antitumour agents.9\n\n      Cucurbitacin E (CuE) is an active compound of the cucurbitacin family.10 Recent reports have demonstrated that CuE possesses various pharmacological functions, such as antiviral, anti\u2010inflammatory and anticancer effects.11, 12, 13 Cucurbitacin E exhibits inhibitory effects in several types of cancer 10, 14; however, its anticancer effect in brain cancer remains unclear. Therefore, the mechanism underlying the antitumour effect of CuE on brain cancer has yet to be identified.\n      Glioblastomas (GBMs) are highly invasive and recurrence brain tumours,15 and have been shown to harbour therapy\u2010resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs), and this is the main cause of death.16, 17 Recent studies indicated that GBMs contain a subpopulation of glioma\u2010initiating tumour cells which exhibits stem cell characteristics and may be responsible for in vivo tumour growth.18, 19 Therefore, we chose the GBM 8401 and glioblastoma\u2010astrocytoma U\u201087\u2010MG cells as human brain cancer model to analyse the antitumour activity of CuE.\n      In the current study, efforts have been initiated to inspect whether CuE can contribute to the anti\u2010proliferation of GBM 8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells. Apoptosis20 and cell cycle regulation21 have been posited as possible targets for cancer therapy, and CuE was found to induce the regulation of cell cycle progression.22 Therefore, we focused specifically on the effects of CuE on the induced delay of mitosis and gene expression in GBM 8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells. We expect that our study may provide a scientific foundation and technological support for brain GBM therapy.\n2\n      MATERIALS AND METHODS\n      \n        2.1\n        Materials\n        All reagents and chemicals were of analytical grade.

Moreover, no significant increase in the ratio of caspase\u20103 activity (data not shown) was observed in CuE\u2010treated cancer cells.\n      \n      \n        3.3\n        CuE enhances the numbers cell populations in the G2/M phase\n        To further investigate the effect of CuE on GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cell growth, the cell cycle distribution among CuE\u2010treated cells was analysed and quantified using flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 1B, treatment with CuE resulted in accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase, implying that the brain cancer cell lines underwent mitosis delay. Our observed delay in mitosis implied that exposure to CuE enhanced the cell number in the G2/M phase while synchronously decrease the cell populations in other phases (Figure 1C).\n      \n      \n        3.4\n        Effects of CuE on the mitotic index\n        MPM\u20102 is a commonly used marker of mitotic disturbance that can bind to phosphorylated amino acid epitopes during mitosis, especially with maximum staining at the G2/M phase. To discriminate G2 arrest from mitotic arrest, we employed MPM\u20102 (anti\u2010phospho\u2010Ser/Thr\u2010Pro)\u2010FITC (Figure 2A) as a mitosis\u2010specific antibody. The cells were treated with an inducer of metaphase arrest, nocodazole (15\u00a0\u00b5g/mL), for 24\u00a0hours as a positive control, which led to the synchronization of the entire cell populations in the G2/M phase and increased the MPM\u20102 labelling (Figure 2B). MPM\u20102 levels were increased in CuE\u2010treated brain cancer cell lines compared with those in the control group (Figure 2B). However, the effects of staining with MPM\u20102 were similar to those of nocodazole in the CuE\u2010treated group. We suggest that cells were possibly stained with MPM\u20102 in diverse stages of mitosis, and part of this result could not be identified by this early mitosis\u2010specific marker. In particular, part of the G2/M cells may remain unstained. Therefore, the increasing of MPM\u20102 staining may imply underestimation of mitotic disturbance.\n        \n          Figure 2\n          \n            Diminished MPM\u20102 activity in cucurbitacin E (CuE)\u2010treated GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells. A, Quantification of MPM\u20102 expression (gated cells) was performed using flow cytometry following treatment with CuE for 24\u00a0h. B, Cucurbitacin E enhanced the level of MPM\u20102 in those cells. As a positive control, separate groups of cells were treated for 24\u00a0h with Nocodazole (15\u00a0\u00b5g/mL), an antifungal agent that induces metaphase arrest. *in each group of bars indicates that the difference resulting from treatment with 0\u00a0\u03bcmol/L CuE was statistically significant at P\u00a0<\u00a00.05\n          \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        3.5\n        G2/M\u2010phase cell cycle arrest by CuE in GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells through CDC2 and cyclin B1disassociation with GADD45\u03b2 up\u2010regulation\n        As shown in Figure 3, cellular proteins were extracted from the brain cancer cell lines treated with CuE, which was followed by qRT\u2010PCR, co\u2010immunoprecipitation (Co\u2010IP) and Western blot analysis. CDC2, cyclin B1 and GADD45\u03b2 gene expression levels were quantified based on measurements of relative intensities. There was no significant change in mRNA levels following treatment with CuE (Figure S2A); in contrast, the protein expressions of CDC2 and cyclin B1 were significantly down\u2010regulated in CuE\u2010treated GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells (Figure S2B,C). Furthermore, Co\u2010IP test was performed to quantify the activities of GADD45\u03b2/CDC2 and cyclin B1/CDC 2, the critical roles for G2\u2010M transition during the cell cycle (Figure 3D). The results indicated that the increasing number of the brain cancer cell lines in the G2/M phase may via CuE\u2010induced association of CDC2 and the GADD45\u03b2 complex (Figure 3E), and the disassociation of the CDC2/cyclin B1 complex in GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells by CuE can be attributed to GADD45\u03b2 up\u2010regulation (Figure 3A\u2010C).\n        \n          Figure 3\n          \n            Cucurbitacin E (CuE) enhances DNA damage 45\u03b2 (GADD45\u03b2) gene expression and CDC2/cyclin B1 disassociation in GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells.

Furthermore, we explored the effect of cellular GADD45\u03b2/CDC2 expression on cell growth\u2010inhibiting activity in GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells. The results revealed that the inhibition of GADD45\u03b2 activity significantly suppressed CuE\u2010induced G2/M arrest in GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells (Figure 4B,C), implying that GADD45\u03b2 could regulate the survival of GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells via CuE.\n      \n      \n        3.7\n        Down\u2010regulation of GADD45\u03b2 in GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells by silencing GADD45\u03b2 was reversed by CuE\u2010induced G2/M arrest\n        To verify the connection between GADD45\u03b2 expression and G2/M arrest in GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells, Lipofectamine RNAiMAX gene delivery techniques were used to modulate cellular GADD45\u03b2 levels, and the influences of GADD45\u03b2 levels on cell growth\u2010inhibiting activity in GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells were investigated. Protein analysis revealed that GADD45\u03b2 was significantly reduced after GADD45\u03b2 was silenced (Figure 5A), whereas quantitative PCR analysis revealed that the higher expression levels of GADD45\u03b2 mRNA in CuE\u2010treated brain cancer cells were significantly decreased after GADD45\u03b2 was silenced (Figure 3A). Moreover, silencing GADD45\u03b2 significantly suppressed CuE\u2010induced G2/M arrest in GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells (Figure 5C,D). The results illustrated that CuE could regulate the cell cycle progression of GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells via GADD45\u03b2.\n        \n          Figure 5\n          \n            Inhibition of DNA damage 45\u03b2 (GADD45\u03b2) could alleviate cell cycle arrest upon cucurbitacin E (CuE) treatment in GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells.

Thus, the results indicated that CuE may induce cell cycle delay in the G2/M phase via dissociation of the cyclin B1/CDC2 complex and up\u2010regulation of GADD45\u03b2 gene expression.\n3.1\n        CuE inhibits the cell viabilities of GBM8401and U\u201087\u2010MG cells\n        To investigate the antitumour effects of CuE on cell survival and proliferation, an in vitro study was applied to treat GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells with 0, 2.5, 5 and 10\u00a0\u03bcmol/L of CuE as indicated for 24\u201072\u00a0hours. As shown in Figure 1A, the viabilities of GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells were significantly inhibited by CuE in a dose\u2010dependent pattern. Microscopic examination was used to observe morphological changes in the cells following 6\u201024\u00a0hours of exposure to 5\u00a0\u03bcmol/L of CuE.

As shown in Figure 1B, treatment with CuE resulted in accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase, implying that the brain cancer cell lines underwent mitosis delay. Our observed delay in mitosis implied that exposure to CuE enhanced the cell number in the G2/M phase while synchronously decrease the cell populations in other phases (Figure 1C).\n3.4\n        Effects of CuE on the mitotic index\n        MPM\u20102 is a commonly used marker of mitotic disturbance that can bind to phosphorylated amino acid epitopes during mitosis, especially with maximum staining at the G2/M phase. To discriminate G2 arrest from mitotic arrest, we employed MPM\u20102 (anti\u2010phospho\u2010Ser/Thr\u2010Pro)\u2010FITC (Figure 2A) as a mitosis\u2010specific antibody. The cells were treated with an inducer of metaphase arrest, nocodazole (15\u00a0\u00b5g/mL), for 24\u00a0hours as a positive control, which led to the synchronization of the entire cell populations in the G2/M phase and increased the MPM\u20102 labelling (Figure 2B). MPM\u20102 levels were increased in CuE\u2010treated brain cancer cell lines compared with those in the control group (Figure 2B). However, the effects of staining with MPM\u20102 were similar to those of nocodazole in the CuE\u2010treated group. We suggest that cells were possibly stained with MPM\u20102 in diverse stages of mitosis, and part of this result could not be identified by this early mitosis\u2010specific marker. In particular, part of the G2/M cells may remain unstained. Therefore, the increasing of MPM\u20102 staining may imply underestimation of mitotic disturbance.\n        \n          Figure 2\n          \n            Diminished MPM\u20102 activity in cucurbitacin E (CuE)\u2010treated GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells.

The results illustrated that CuE could regulate the cell cycle progression of GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells via GADD45\u03b2.\n        \n          Figure 5\n          \n            Inhibition of DNA damage 45\u03b2 (GADD45\u03b2) could alleviate cell cycle arrest upon cucurbitacin E (CuE) treatment in GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells.

The control group was used as 100% (target gene/beta actin\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100%) to calculate the ratio of each group. All data are reported as the mean (\u00b1SEM) of three separate experiments. *P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 compared with control; @\nP\u00a0<\u00a00.05 compared with CuE 5\u00a0\u03bcmol/L\n          \n          \n        \n        The results from PCR array detection where a focused panel of genes was analysed by a RT2 Profiler\u2122 PCR Array (PAHS\u2010020Z, QIAGEN; data not shown) were further confirmed by quantitative PCR analysis (Figure 3A; Figure S2), which indicated substantial GADD45\u03b2 up\u2010regulation as well as significant down\u2010regulation of cyclin B, CDC2 and the GADD45\u03b2/CDC2 association in the CuE\u2010treated GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells. Thus, the results indicated that CuE may induce cell cycle delay in the G2/M phase via dissociation of the cyclin B1/CDC2 complex and up\u2010regulation of GADD45\u03b2 gene expression.\n4\n      DISCUSSION\n      Our findings provide experimental evidence indicating that CuE may irreversibly arrest GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cell growth. Previous studies indicated that CuE could significantly inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells and HL\u201060 cells by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest.14, 22, 23 Moreover, CuE could induce cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase by altering mitotic spindles in U2OS, MCF7 and HeLa cancer cells.24 According to the current study, accumulation of CuE in GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells is the major cause leading to both the inhibition of cell proliferation and G2/M phase arrest.\n      Growth arrest and DNA damage 45 proteins have been implicated in the activation of the G2/M checkpoint.25 DNA damage 45 can directly inhibit the activity of cyclin B1/CDC2 kinase by interacting with CDC2.26 DNA damage 45\u03b2, a member of GADD45 family, is an 18\u2010kDa protein closely related to GADD45\u03b1 and GADD45\u03b3, which is associated with cell growth control.27, 28 DNA damage 45\u03b2 is also a novel tumour suppressor, the tumour\u2010blocking function of which was illustrated by reducing cell proliferation and survival.29 In the current study, we investigated that CuE blocking cell cycle progression and inducing GADD45 gene expression via association with the CDC2/GADD45 complex and displacement of cyclin B1 from the CDC2/cyclin B1 complex in Figure 3. Our finding indicated that CuE in the explored cancer cells led to down\u2010regulation of the association of the cyclin B1/CDC2 complex and the up\u2010regulation of GADD45\u03b2. Moreover, GADD45\u03b2 exhibited its binding to the CDC2/cyclin B1 complex, and then regulates the G2/M phases. Previous evidence suggested that the binding of CDC2 with GADD45\u03b330 and Gadd45 family genes is essential for the regulation of antitumour immune responses.31 DNA damage 45 gene family participates in cell cycle control, and each of the GADD45 genes may play similar, but not identical, roles in tumorigenesis. Decreased gene expression of GADD45\u2010\u03b1 and \u2010\u03b3, but not \u2010\u03b2, were detected in 138 gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) tissues.32 The c\u2010Jun N\u2010terminal kinase/stress\u2010activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK), encoded by three genes, were responsive to UV irradiation and heat shock.33 Sustained activation of JNK is usually thought to be involved in inflammation, apoptosis and proliferation.34 DNA damage 45\u03b2 is important for ERK, p38 and JNK signalling.35 DNA damage 45\u03b2 could inhibit tumour necrosis factor \u03b1\u2010induced JNK signalling via interaction with the JNK kinase, MKK7/JNKK2.36, 37 However, the expressions of ERK and JNK were not changed significantly following CuE treatment (Figure S2D). Our results indicated that the mitosis delay by CuE is through up\u2010regulating GADD45\u03b2, rather than down\u2010regulating the gene expression and phosphorylation of ERK and JNK, in GBM8401 and U\u201087\u2010MG cells. Our experimental evidence indicates that the accumulation of CuE in cancer cells could inhibit proliferation and irreversibly arrest the growth of brain cancer cells.\n      In summary, in this study, efforts were made to determine that CuE is an effective inhibitor of brain cancer cell lines medicated by GADD45\u03b2. The mechanism of CuE involvement in the inhibition of tumour growth was highlighted by the delay of mitosis via the up\u2010regulation of GADD45\u03b2 expression. The present results speculate the appropriateness of CuE as a potential anticancer agent for the chemoprevention of brain cancer.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n      The authors declare no conflict of interest.\nSupporting information\n      \n        \n          \u00a0\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \u00a0\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \u00a0\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \u00a0\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \u00a0\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \u00a0\n        \n        \n          \n            Click here for additional data file.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6484297/\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/jcmm.14250",
