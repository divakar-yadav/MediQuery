    "title": "Detection of Human Brain Cancer Infiltration ex vivo and in vivo Using Quantitative Optical Coherence Tomography",
    "abstract": "More complete brain cancer resection can prolong survival and delay recurrence. However, it is \nchallenging to distinguish cancer from non-cancer tissues intraoperatively, especially at the \ntransitional, infiltrative zones. This is especially critical in eloquent regions (e.g. speech and motor \nareas). This study tested the feasibility of label-free, quantitative optical coherence tomography \n(OCT) for differentiating cancer from non-cancer in human brain tissues. Fresh ex vivo human \nbrain tissues were obtained from 32 patients with grades II-IV brain cancer and 5 patients with \nnon-cancer brain pathologies. Based on volumetric OCT imaging data, pathologically confirmed \nbrain cancer tissues (both high-grade and low-grade) had significantly lower optical attenuation \nvalues at both cancer core and infiltrated zones when compared with non-cancer white matter, and \nOCT achieved high sensitivity and specificity at an attenuation threshold of 5.5 mm-1 for brain \ncancer patients. We also used this attenuation threshold to confirm the intraoperative feasibility of \nperforming in vivo OCT-guided surgery using a murine model harboring human brain cancer. Our \nOCT system was capable of processing and displaying a color-coded optical property map in real \ntime at a rate of 110-215 frames per second, or 1.2-2.4 seconds for an 8-16 mm3 tissue volume, \nthus providing direct visual cues for cancer versus non-cancer areas. Our study demonstrates the \ntranslational and practical potential of OCT in differentiating cancer from non-cancer tissue.
