    "description": "Objectives\n          There is an ongoing debate on the possible association between infections in early childhood and subsequent cancer risk, but it remains unclear if a hospital admission for infection is associated with risk of childhood cancer diagnosis. We examined if a hospital-based diagnosis of pneumonia was a clinical marker of the three most common childhood cancers.\nDesign\n          Population-based cohort study.\nSetting\n          Denmark, hospital diagnoses, 1994\u20132013.\nMethods\n          Using national health registries, we compared the observed incidence of leukaemia, lymphoma and brain cancer among 83\u2009935 children with a hospital-based pneumonia diagnosis with that expected among children in the general population. We calculated absolute cancer risks and standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) as a measure of relative risk.\nResults\n      \n        Patient characteristics\n        We followed 83\u2009935 children with pneumonia and no previous cancer diagnosis for a median of 10 years. The incidence of pneumonia diagnosis was stable over the 20-year period. In the cohort as a whole, 47\u2009650 (57%) were boys, and median age was 1.5 years. Pneumonia diagnosis was made during an inpatient stay among 89%, during an outpatient clinic visit in 6% and in the emergency room in 5% of the children. Pneumonia was registered as the main condition leading to hospitalisation for 69\u2009479 (83%) children. Of the 49\u2009510 children diagnosed with pneumonia after 2002, 36\u2009230 (73%) had chest imaging performed during their hospital contact. Pneumonia was registered as caused by bacteria in 14% and by viruses in 22% of children in the study cohort (see the online\u00a0supplementary appendix for specification of aetiology), while the agent was unspecified for 64% of the children. Among the children, 8733 (10%) had a congenital malformation (table 1), including 489 children with Down syndrome. The prevalence of immune deficiencies recorded in the DNPR at the time of pneumonia diagnosis was low (n=137). The majority had one or no previous hospitalisations, while 25% had two or more previous hospitalisations with a minimum duration of 3 days.\n        \n          Table 1\n          \n            Risk of leukaemia, lymphoma and brain cancer, stratified analysis\n          \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                n\n                O/E\n                SIR (95%\u2009CI)\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                All\n                83\u2009935\n                168/90\n                1.9 (1.6 to 2.2)\n              \n              \n                \u2003Boys\n                47\u2009650\n                89/53\n                1.7 (1.3 to 2.1)\n              \n              \n                \u2003Girls\n                36\u2009285\n                79/37\n                2.2 (1.7 to 2.7)\n              \n              \n                Age\n              \n              \n                \u20030\u20134\n                70\u2009476\n                135/76\n                1.8 (1.5 to 2.1)\n              \n              \n                \u20035\u20139\n                8145\n                14/8\n                1.7 (0.9 to 2.8)\n              \n              \n                \u200310\u201314\n                3114\n                8/3\n                2.3 (1.0 to 4.5)\n              \n              \n                \u200315\u201317\n                2200\n                11/3\n                4.2 (2.1 to 7.5)\n              \n              \n                Previous hospitalisations\n              \n              \n                \u20030\n                18\u2009114\n                20/17\n                1.2 (0.7 to 1.9)\n              \n              \n                \u20031\n                45\u2009161\n                94/50\n                1.9 (1.5 to 2.3)\n              \n              \n                \u20032\n                11\u2009953\n                24/14\n                1.8 (1.1 to 2.6)\n              \n              \n                \u20033+\n                8707\n                30/10\n                3.1 (2.1 to 4.4)\n              \n              \n                Calendar period\n              \n              \n                \u20031994\u20131998\n                21\u2009618\n                96/81\n                1.2 (1.0 to 1.4)\n              \n              \n                \u20031999\u20132003\n                21\u2009067\n                61/49\n                1.3 (1.0 to 1.6)\n              \n              \n                \u20032004\u20132008\n                20\u2009644\n                54/29\n                1.9 (1.4 to 2.5)\n              \n              \n                \u20032009\u20132013\n                20\u2009607\n                30/12\n                2.5 (1.7 to 3.5)\n              \n              \n                Congenital malformations\n              \n              \n                \u2003Yes\n                8733\n                31*/9\n                3.7 (2.5 to 5.2)\n              \n              \n                \u2003Down\u00a0syndrome\n                489\n                9/1\n                16.2\u00a0(7.4\u00a0to\u00a030.8)\n              \n              \n                \u2003No\n                75\u2009202\n                137/81\n                1.7 (1.4 to 2.0)\n              \n              \n                Immune deficiency\n              \n              \n                \u2003Yes\n                137\n                2/0.1\n                17.5 (2.1 to 63.2)\n              \n              \n                \u2003No\n                83\u2009798\n                166/90\n                1.9 (1.6 to 2.2)\n              \n              \n                Imaging examination (after 2002)\n              \n              \n                \u2003Yes\n                36\u2009230\n                66/25\n                2.7 (2.1 to 3.4)\n              \n              \n                \u2003No\n                13\u2009280\n                9/8\n                1.1 (0.5 to 2.1)\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Congenital malformations included conditions related to the nervous system (Q00-Q07);

The SIRs were substantially increased during the first 6 months of follow-up: 6.2 (95% CI 3.5\u00a0to 10.3) for lymphoid leukaemia, 14.8 (95% CI 6.0\u00a0to 30.6) for myeloid leukaemia, 60.8 (95% CI 26.2\u00a0to 120) for Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, 15.9 (95% CI 5.2\u00a0to 37.2) for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and 4.4 (95% CI 1.9\u00a0to 8.7) for brain cancer (table 2). The increased risk of lymphoid leukaemia, myeloid leukaemia and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma persisted up to 5 years after a hospital pneumonia diagnosis. Beyond 5 years of follow-up, more children than expected were diagnosed with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas and brain cancers (table 2).\n        The stratified analyses for the overall cancer occurrence showed slightly higher SIRs among girls than among boys. Children up to 14 years of age had an approximately twofold increased SIR, whereas teenagers aged 15\u201317 years had a fourfold increased SIR (table 1). The SIR increased over time from 1.2-fold increased during 1994\u20131998 to 2.5-fold increased during 2009\u20132013. Children with imaging-confirmed diagnoses had a SIR of almost three, whereas children without confirmed diagnosis had a SIR around the unity (table 1). Though numbers were low, children diagnosed with immune deficiencies or congenital malformations had higher SIRs for cancer than children without these conditions. However, importantly the increased risk was not confined to children with such known conditions. While the overall SIR for children without previous hospitalisations was around unity, the SIR for children with one or two visits was almost twofold increased, and the SIR for those with three or more visits was threefold increased (table 1).\nConclusions\n          The short-term incidence of leukaemia, lymphoma and brain cancer was higher than expected and persisted beyond 5 years for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and brain cancer. However, the absolute cancer risk was low.\nIntroduction\n      Presenting signs of cancer in children may be vague and overlap with those of common childhood conditions. While the disease course for leukaemia is often short, the symptoms of brain cancer may present already 2\u2009years before diagnosis.1 General practitioners (GPs) are often essential in the early diagnostic pathways,2 but it is plausible that cancer in some children debut with acute clinical disease necessitating hospitalisation. Hospital admission for infection is not clearly associated with risk of childhood cancer. Some studies have shown that overall there is no association with previous admission for infectious diseases and risk of leukaemia,3 while others have found that children with common infections requiring hospitalisation potentially have a 50% higher risk of a subsequent leukaemia diagnosis.4 Specifically, a hospital diagnosis of pneumonia may be associated with subsequent increased risk of a leukaemia diagnosis.5 Pneumonia is a frequent cause of community-acquired infection leading to hospital contact (annual incidence is up to 40 per 10\u00a0000)6; therefore, any association with cancer could be clinically relevant. If absolute cancer risks in children with a hospital-based diagnosis of pneumonia are high, then this could have implications for the diagnostic approach in these children.\n      We assessed absolute and relative risks of the three most common childhood cancers, leukaemia, lymphoma and brain cancer7 subsequent to a first hospital-based diagnosis of pneumonia.\nMaterials and methods\n      The source population for this registry-based cohort was all Danish children aged 0\u201317 years who were alive between 1994 and 2013 (n=2\u00a0884\u00a0552). Access to medical care including hospital admissions is free\u00a0of charge (tax\u00a0paid). The Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR) captures all contacts with Danish hospitals,8 and records discharge diagnosis using the International Classification of Diseases (currently the 10th revision). The Danish Cancer Registry (DCR) records incident cancers in Denmark using ICD-10 and ICD-0\u20133 morphology codes.9\n\n      We identified all children with a first-time hospital-based (inpatient, outpatient clinic and emergency room) diagnosis of pneumonia recorded in the DNPR during 1994\u20132013. We linked these cases to the DCR (using a unique personal identification) to identify incident cancers, and then to exclude children with previous cancer diagnoses. Owing to the low cancer incidence in the cohort, we had sufficient sample size to estimate only the risks of the three most common childhood cancers. We used information on registrations of chest imaging during hospitalisation (recorded since 2002) to examine the proportion of imaging-confirmed pneumonia diagnoses. We obtained information from the DNPR on prevalent diagnoses of immune deficiencies and congenital diseases, including Down syndrome. We searched for hospitalisations before pneumonia diagnosis to elucidate the extent of previous hospital contacts. All codes used in the study are provided in the online supplementary appendix.\n      \n        10.1136/bmjopen-2017-019860.supp1\n        Supplementary file 1\n        \n\n      \n      \n        Statistical analysis\n        The children were followed for the occurrence of cancer from the date of the pneumonia diagnosis until death, emigration or end of follow-up 30\u00a0November 2013. We computed the absolute cancer risk at 6 months and 5 years following the pneumonia diagnosis.\n        We compared the observed cancer incidence among children with pneumonia with that expected among children in the general population (based on national cancer incidence rates by age, sex and calendar year). Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated as a measure of relative risk. We computed SIRs for acute myeloid leukaemia, acute lymphoid leukaemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and brain cancer. Follow-up was divided into first 6 months, 6 months to 5 years and 5+\u00a0years. We stratified the patients by gender, age, calendar period and prevalent disease to examine its potential impact on cancer risk.\n        All statistical analyses were conducted using the SAS statistical software package V.9.2 (SAS Institute).\nStatistical analysis\n        The children were followed for the occurrence of cancer from the date of the pneumonia diagnosis until death, emigration or end of follow-up 30\u00a0November 2013.

The incidence of pneumonia diagnosis was stable over the 20-year period. In the cohort as a whole, 47\u2009650 (57%) were boys, and median age was 1.5 years. Pneumonia diagnosis was made during an inpatient stay among 89%, during an outpatient clinic visit in 6% and in the emergency room in 5% of the children. Pneumonia was registered as the main condition leading to hospitalisation for 69\u2009479 (83%) children. Of the 49\u2009510 children diagnosed with pneumonia after 2002, 36\u2009230 (73%) had chest imaging performed during their hospital contact. Pneumonia was registered as caused by bacteria in 14% and by viruses in 22% of children in the study cohort (see the online\u00a0supplementary appendix for specification of aetiology), while the agent was unspecified for 64% of the children. Among the children, 8733 (10%) had a congenital malformation (table 1), including 489 children with Down syndrome. The prevalence of immune deficiencies recorded in the DNPR at the time of pneumonia diagnosis was low (n=137). The majority had one or no previous hospitalisations, while 25% had two or more previous hospitalisations with a minimum duration of 3 days.\n        \n          Table 1\n          \n            Risk of leukaemia, lymphoma and brain cancer, stratified analysis\n          \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                n\n                O/E\n                SIR (95%\u2009CI)\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                All\n                83\u2009935\n                168/90\n                1.9 (1.6 to 2.2)\n              \n              \n                \u2003Boys\n                47\u2009650\n                89/53\n                1.7 (1.3 to 2.1)\n              \n              \n                \u2003Girls\n                36\u2009285\n                79/37\n                2.2 (1.7 to 2.7)\n              \n              \n                Age\n              \n              \n                \u20030\u20134\n                70\u2009476\n                135/76\n                1.8 (1.5 to 2.1)\n              \n              \n                \u20035\u20139\n                8145\n                14/8\n                1.7 (0.9 to 2.8)\n              \n              \n                \u200310\u201314\n                3114\n                8/3\n                2.3 (1.0 to 4.5)\n              \n              \n                \u200315\u201317\n                2200\n                11/3\n                4.2 (2.1 to 7.5)\n              \n              \n                Previous hospitalisations\n              \n              \n                \u20030\n                18\u2009114\n                20/17\n                1.2 (0.7 to 1.9)\n              \n              \n                \u20031\n                45\u2009161\n                94/50\n                1.9 (1.5 to 2.3)\n              \n              \n                \u20032\n                11\u2009953\n                24/14\n                1.8 (1.1 to 2.6)\n              \n              \n                \u20033+\n                8707\n                30/10\n                3.1 (2.1 to 4.4)\n              \n              \n                Calendar period\n              \n              \n                \u20031994\u20131998\n                21\u2009618\n                96/81\n                1.2 (1.0 to 1.4)\n              \n              \n                \u20031999\u20132003\n                21\u2009067\n                61/49\n                1.3 (1.0 to 1.6)\n              \n              \n                \u20032004\u20132008\n                20\u2009644\n                54/29\n                1.9 (1.4 to 2.5)\n              \n              \n                \u20032009\u20132013\n                20\u2009607\n                30/12\n                2.5 (1.7 to 3.5)\n              \n              \n                Congenital malformations\n              \n              \n                \u2003Yes\n                8733\n                31*/9\n                3.7 (2.5 to 5.2)\n              \n              \n                \u2003Down\u00a0syndrome\n                489\n                9/1\n                16.2\u00a0(7.4\u00a0to\u00a030.8)\n              \n              \n                \u2003No\n                75\u2009202\n                137/81\n                1.7 (1.4 to 2.0)\n              \n              \n                Immune deficiency\n              \n              \n                \u2003Yes\n                137\n                2/0.1\n                17.5 (2.1 to 63.2)\n              \n              \n                \u2003No\n                83\u2009798\n                166/90\n                1.9 (1.6 to 2.2)\n              \n              \n                Imaging examination (after 2002)\n              \n              \n                \u2003Yes\n                36\u2009230\n                66/25\n                2.7 (2.1 to 3.4)\n              \n              \n                \u2003No\n                13\u2009280\n                9/8\n                1.1 (0.5 to 2.1)\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Congenital malformations included conditions related to the nervous system (Q00-Q07); eye, ear, face and neck (Q10-Q18); the circulatory system (Q20-Q28); the respiratory system (Q30-Q34); cleft lip and cleft palate (Q35-Q37); the digestive system (Q38-Q45); genital organs (Q50-Q56); the urinary system (Q60-Q64); malformations and deformations of the musculoskeletal system (Q65-Q79) and other (Q80-Q99).\n            \n            \n              O/E, observed/expected number of cancer; SIR, standardised incidence ratio.\nRisk of leukaemia, lymphoma and brain cancer\n        A total of 168 cancers were diagnosed during follow-up (826\u2009281 person-years), including 37 diagnosed with cancer within 1\u2009month, adding up to 43 cancers within the first 6 months following the pneumonia episode.

The SIRs were substantially increased during the first 6 months of follow-up: 6.2 (95% CI 3.5\u00a0to 10.3) for lymphoid leukaemia, 14.8 (95% CI 6.0\u00a0to 30.6) for myeloid leukaemia, 60.8 (95% CI 26.2\u00a0to 120) for Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, 15.9 (95% CI 5.2\u00a0to 37.2) for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and 4.4 (95% CI 1.9\u00a0to 8.7) for brain cancer (table 2). The increased risk of lymphoid leukaemia, myeloid leukaemia and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma persisted up to 5 years after a hospital pneumonia diagnosis. Beyond 5 years of follow-up, more children than expected were diagnosed with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas and brain cancers (table 2).\n        The stratified analyses for the overall cancer occurrence showed slightly higher SIRs among girls than among boys. Children up to 14 years of age had an approximately twofold increased SIR, whereas teenagers aged 15\u201317 years had a fourfold increased SIR (table 1). The SIR increased over time from 1.2-fold increased during 1994\u20131998 to 2.5-fold increased during 2009\u20132013. Children with imaging-confirmed diagnoses had a SIR of almost three, whereas children without confirmed diagnosis had a SIR around the unity (table 1). Though numbers were low, children diagnosed with immune deficiencies or congenital malformations had higher SIRs for cancer than children without these conditions. However, importantly the increased risk was not confined to children with such known conditions. While the overall SIR for children without previous hospitalisations was around unity, the SIR for children with one or two visits was almost twofold increased, and the SIR for those with three or more visits was threefold increased (table 1).\nDiscussion\n      We found that a hospital-based diagnosis of pneumonia was a rare presentation of occult childhood cancer. The children hospitalised with pneumonia had a higher short-term incidence of leukaemia, lymphoma and brain cancer than expected and had a persistently increased risk of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and brain cancer more than 5\u2009years after the pneumonia. However, the absolute risk of cancer was low, which accords with the low incidence of childhood malignancies.\n      The association between hospital-based diagnoses of common infections and subsequent cancer occurrence are conflicting. A Danish population-based study found no overall association with previous admission for infectious diseases and risk of leukaemia. However, the study did not explore risks according to type of infection.3 By contrast, a French case\u2013control study indicated that common infections occurring in children during the first year of life potentially were associated with decreased risk of leukaemia, whereas children with infections requiring hospitalisation could be at increased risk of a leukaemia diagnosis.4 Supporting the latter finding, a Taiwan case\u2013control study found that a hospital diagnosis of pneumonia was associated with subsequent increased risk of myeloid leukaemia diagnosis.5\u00a0We found that children presenting with pneumonia had a subsequent higher occurrence of leukaemia, lymphoma and brain cancer than other Danish children.\n      The strengths of our study include its population-based design in the setting of a uniformly organised healthcare system. In agreement with the overall completeness of chest X-ray records in the DNPR,10 we found that the majority of diagnoses were based on imaging procedures. In\u00a0addition, cancer diagnoses in the DCR have high completeness and validity.9 We included children with immune deficiency and congenital malformations, which are known to have higher incidence of both pneumonia and cancer. However, in the analyses excluding these children, the results remained unchanged. Our study also had potential limitations. We could not separate the order of the diagnoses among those diagnosed with pneumonia and cancer during same admission nor identify children in whom lymphoma was initially falsely interpreted as pneumonia. We used hospital-based diagnosis of pneumonia within the setting of a developed country. Accordingly, generalisability may be transferable to other industrial Western societies but not necessarily to undeveloped countries neither to pneumonia diagnosis in the general practice setting.\n      There are several possible explanations for our findings. Chest X-rays and blood tests performed as part of workup for pneumonia may have yielded findings suspicious of cancer leading on to further examinations. In addition, lymphoma with a mediastinal mass or with lung involvement may have initially been misdiagnosed as pneumonia in some cases. Children with cancer have higher GP consultation rates than controls in\u00a0the year preceding the cancer diagnosis.11 In agreement, we found higher SIRs for children with previous hospital contacts, thus pneumonia may not have been the first clinical disease in all children. Although increased diagnostic effort may partially explain the higher short-term occurrence of cancer, it is unlikely to explain the increased risk of lymphoma and brain cancer observed more than 5\u2009years after pneumonia. There is an ongoing debate on whether or not infectious diseases in children may modulate the child\u2019s immune response potentially leading to decreased or increased risk of cancer.12\u201314 We did not attempt to address or clarify this hypothesis as our data would not allow us to do so. However, we speculate if the associations demonstrated may be due to cancer-related impairment of the immune system, making a child more vulnerable to severe infections such as pneumonia. In children with an aggressive type of cancer, the infection may lead on to cancer diagnosis, whereas in children with a more indolent cancer, the infection occurs in the preclinical phase.1\n\n      Based on the low absolute cancer risks observed, our findings do not warrant a change in the workup of children diagnosed with pneumonia during a hospital admission.\nSupplementary Material\n      \n        \n          Reviewer comments\n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Author's manuscript\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5778340/\nhttps://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-019860",
