    "title": "The roles of microglia/macrophages in tumor progression of brain cancer and metastatic disease",
    "abstract": "Malignant brain tumors and brain metastases are highly aggressive diseases that are often resistant \nto treatments. Consequently, the current prognosis of patients with brain tumors and metastases is \ndismal. Activated microglia and macrophages are often observed in close proximity to or within \nthe malignant tumor masses, suggesting that microglia/macrophages play an important role in \nbrain tumor progression. Microglia, being resident macrophages of the central nervous system, \nform a major component of the brain immune system. They exhibit anti-tumor functions by \nphagocytosis and the release of cytotoxic factors. However, these microglia/macrophages can be \npolarized into becoming tumor-supportive and immunosuppressive cells by certain tumor-derived \nsoluble factors, thereby promoting tumor maintenance and progression. The activated microglia/\nmacrophages also participate in the process of tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, dormancy, and \nrelapse. In this review, we discuss the recent literature on the dual roles of microglia/macrophages \nin brain tumor progression. We have also reviewed the effect of several well-known microglia/\nmacrophages-derived molecules and signals on brain tumor progression and further discussed the \npotential therapeutic strategies for targeting the pro-tumor and metastatic functions of microglia/\nmacrophages.\nKeywords\nMicroglia; Macrophage; brain tumor; brain metastasis\n2.",
