    "title": "Metabolic Heterogeneity and Adaptability in Brain Tumors",
    "abstract": "The metabolic complexity and flexibility commonly observed in brain tumors, especially \nglioblastoma, is fundamental for their development and progression. The ability of tumor cells to \nmodify their genetic landscape and adapt metabolically, subverts therapeutic efficacy and \ninevitably instigates therapeutic resistance. In order to overcome these challenges and develop \neffective therapeutic strategies targeting essential metabolic processes, it is to necessary to identify \nthe mechanisms underlying heterogeneity and define metabolic preferences and liabilities of \nmalignant cells. In this review we will discuss metabolic diversity in brain cancer and highlight the \nrole of cancer stem cells in regulating metabolic heterogeneity. We will also highlight potential \ntherapeutic modalities targeting metabolic vulnerabilities and examine how intercellular metabolic \nsignaling can shape the tumor microenvironment.\nKeywords\nGlioma; tumor microenvironment (TME); metabolism; cell communication; tumor initiating cells; \nslow-cycling cells; immune cells",
