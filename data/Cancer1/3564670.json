    "abstract": "Brain cancer tumors cause disruption of the selective properties of vascular endothelia, even\ncausing disruptions in the very selective blood\u2013brain barrier, which are collectively referred to as\nthe blood\u2013brain\u2013tumor barrier. Nanoparticles (NPs) have previously shown great promise in\ntaking advantage of this increased vascular permeability in other cancers, which results in\nincreased accumulation in these cancers over time due to the accompanying loss of an effective\nlymph system. NPs have therefore attracted increased attention for treating brain cancer. While\nthis research is just beginning, there have been many successes demonstrated thus far in both the\nlaboratory and clinical setting. This review serves to present the reader with an overview of NPs\nfor treating brain cancer and to provide an outlook on what may come in the future. For NPs, just\nlike the blood\u2013brain\u2013tumor barrier, the future is wide open.\nKeywords\nbrain tumors; clinical trials; drug delivery; imaging; nanoparticles; theranostics\nUse of nanoparticles for brain cancer\nDuring one of the greatest periods of human achievement, the industrial revolution,\nhumanity sought to expand ever outward and upward. A radical change has recently\noccurred, where in less than a century we have gone from developing macroscopic machines\nand structures to developing technology that is smaller than the width of a single human\nhair. We now see ourselves looking for smaller, more compact solutions to solve problems\nin the development of nanotechnology, seeking to become more efficient and less wasteful\nthan a century ago. In addition, humans are now living longer due to an ever-improving\nunderstanding of our own physiology [1]. Nanomedicine has developed during this time,\nfueled by an ever-increasing pressure from society for more efficacious treatments as the\ncost of healthcare and populations continue to rise [2]. The general definition of\nnanotechnology is the creation and use of materials that have dimensions in the range of 1\u2013\n100 nm [3\u20135]. However, many larger particles, sometimes as large as 1000 nm, have also\n\u00a9 2013 Future Medicine Ltd\n*Author for correspondence: james.basilion@case.edu.\nFinancial & competing interests disclosure\nThe authors have no relevant affiliations or financial involvement with any organization or entity with a financial interest in or\nfinancial conflict with the subject matter or materials discussed in the manuscript.\nNo writing assistance was utilized in the production of this manuscript.\nNIH Public Access\nAuthor Manuscript\nNanomedicine (Lond).
