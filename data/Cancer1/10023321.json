    "title": "Nonviral nanoparticle gene delivery into the CNS for neurological disorders and brain cancer applications",
    "abstract": "Nonviral nanoparticles have emerged as an attractive alternative to viral vectors for gene \ntherapy applications, utilizing a range of lipid-based, polymeric, and inorganic materials. These \nmaterials can either encapsulate or be functionalized to bind nucleic acids and protect them from \ndegradation. To effectively elicit changes to gene expression, the nanoparticle carrier needs to \nundergo a series of steps intracellularly, from interacting with the cellular membrane to facilitate \ncellular uptake to endosomal escape and nucleic acid release. Adjusting physiochemical properties \nof the nanoparticles, such as size, charge, and targeting ligands, can improve cellular uptake and \nultimately gene delivery. Applications in the central nervous system (CNS; i.e., neurological \ndiseases, brain cancers) face further extracellular barriers for a gene-carrying nanoparticle \nto surpass, with the most significant being the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Approaches to \novercome these extracellular challenges to deliver nanoparticles into the CNS include systemic, \nintracerebroventricular, intrathecal, and intranasal administration. This review describes and \ncompares different biomaterials for nonviral nanoparticle-mediated gene therapy to the CNS and \nexplores challenges and recent preclinical and clinical developments in overcoming barriers to \nnanoparticle-mediated delivery to the brain.\nThis article is categorized under:\nTherapeutic Approaches and Drug Discovery > Nanomedicine for Neurological Disease\nCorrespondence: Jordan J.
