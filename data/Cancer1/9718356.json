    "title": "Association between airport-related ultrafine particles and risk of malignant brain cancer: a multiethnic cohort study",
    "abstract": "Ultrafine particles (UFP) (diameter less than or equal to 100 nanometers), may reach the brain via \nsystemic circulation or the olfactory tract and have been implicated in the risk of brain tumors. The \neffects of airport-related UFP on the risk of brain tumors are not known. Here we determined the \nassociation between airport-related UFP and risk of incident malignant brain cancer (n=155) and \nmeningioma (n=420) diagnosed during 16.4 years of follow-up among 75,936 men and women \nresiding in Los Angeles County from the Multiethnic Cohort study. UFP exposure from aircrafts \nwas estimated for participants who lived within a 53 by 43 kilometer grid area around the Los \nAngeles International Airport (LAX) from date of cohort entry (1993\u20131996) through December \n31, 2013. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the effects of time-varying, \nairport-related UFP exposure on risk of malignant brain cancer and meningioma, adjusting for \nsex, race/ethnicity, education, and neighborhood socioeconomic status. Malignant brain cancer \nrisk in all subjects combined increased 12% (95% CI 0.98\u20131.27) per interquartile range (IQR) of \nairport-related UFP exposure (~6700 particles per cm3) for subjects with any address in the grid \narea surrounding the LAX airport. In race/ethnicity-stratified analyses, African Americans, the \nsubgroup who had the highest exposure, showed a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.32 (95% CI 1.07\u20131.64) \n*Corresponding Author: Anna H.
