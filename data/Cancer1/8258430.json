    "abstract": "The incidence of brain metastases is increasing as cancer therapies improve and patients live \nlonger, providing new challenges to the multidisciplinary teams that care for these patients. Brain \nmetastatic cancer cells possess unique characteristics that allow them to penetrate the blood brain \nbarrier, colonize the brain parenchyma, and persist in the intracranial environment. Additionally, \nbrain metastases subvert the innate and adaptive immune system, permitting evasion of the anti-\ntumor immune response. Better understanding of the above mechanisms will allow for \ndevelopment and delivery of more effective therapies for brain metastases. In this review, we \noutline the molecular mechanisms underlying development, survival, and immunosuppression of \nbrain metastases. We also discuss current and emerging treatment strategies, including surgery, \nradiation, disease-specific and mutation-targeted systemic therapy, and immunotherapy.\nKeywords\nGlioblastoma; brain cancer; brain metastases; immunotherapy",
