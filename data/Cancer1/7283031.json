    "title": "Consensus recommendations for a standardized brain tumor imaging protocol for clinical trials in brain metastases",
    "abstract": "A recent meeting was held on March 22, 2019, among the FDA, clinical scientists, pharmaceutical and biotech com-\npanies, clinical trials cooperative groups, and patient advocacy groups to discuss challenges and potential solu-\ntions for increasing development of therapeutics for central nervous system metastases. A\u00a0key issue identified at \nthis meeting was the need for consistent tumor measurement for reliable tumor response assessment, including \nthe first step of standardized image acquisition with an MRI protocol that could be implemented in multicenter \nstudies aimed at testing new therapeutics. This document builds upon previous consensus recommendations for \na standardized brain tumor imaging protocol (BTIP) in high-grade gliomas and defines a protocol for brain me-\ntastases (BTIP-BM) that addresses unique challenges associated with assessment of CNS metastases. The \u201cmin-\nimum standard\u201d recommended pulse sequences include: (i) parameter matched pre- and post-contrast inversion \nrecovery (IR)\u2013prepared, isotropic 3D \nT1-weighted gradient echo (IR-GRE); (ii) axial 2D \nT2-weighted turbo spin echo \nacquired after injection of gadolinium-based contrast agent and before post-contrast 3D T1-weighted images;",
