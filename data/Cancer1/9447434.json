    "abstract": "The CBTRUS Statistical Report: Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation Childhood and Adolescent Primary Brain \nand Other Central Nervous System Tumors Diagnosed in the United States in 2014\u20132018 comprehensively \ndescribes the current population-based incidence of primary malignant and non-malignant brain and other \nCNS tumors in children and adolescents ages 0\u201319\u00a0years, collected and reported by central cancer regis-\ntries covering approximately 100% of the United States population. Overall, brain and other CNS tumors \nare the most common solid tumor, the most common cancer, and the most common cause of cancer death \nin children and adolescents ages 0\u201319\u00a0years. This report aims to serve as a useful resource for researchers, \nclinicians, patients, and families.\nExecutive\u00a0Summary\nThe Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States \n(CBTRUS), in collaboration with the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (CDC) and National Cancer Institute \n(NCI), is the largest population-based registry focused ex-\nclusively on primary brain and other central nervous system \n(CNS) tumors in the United States and represents the entire \nUnited States population. The CBTRUS Statistical Report: \nPediatric Brain Tumor Foundation Childhood and Adolescent \nPrimary Brain and Other Central Nervous System Tumors \nDiagnosed in the United States in 2014\u20132018 contains the most \nup-to-date population-based data on primary brain and other \nCNS tumors in children and adolescents available through \nthe surveillance system in the United States and supersedes \nall previous reports in terms of completeness and accuracy, \nthereby providing a current comprehensive source for the de-\nscriptive epidemiology of these\u00a0tumors.\nIncidence\n\u2022\t The annual average age-specific incidence rate of all ma-\nlignant and non-malignant brain and other CNS tumors \nin children and adolescents ages 0\u201319\u00a0years was 6.23 per \n100,000 population between 2014 and 2018. When stratified \nby behavior, incidence was 3.55 per 100,000 population for \nmalignant tumors only, and 2.67 for non-malignant tumors \nonly.",
