    "abstract": "Brain drug delivery is a major challenge for therapy of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. \nBiochemical modifications of drugs or drug nanocarriers, methods of local delivery, and blood\u2013\nbrain barrier (BBB) disruption with focused ultrasound and microbubbles are promising \napproaches which enhance transport or bypass the BBB. These approaches are discussed in the \ncontext of brain cancer as an example in CNS drug development. Targeting to receptors enabling \ntransport across the BBB offers noninvasive delivery of small molecule and biological cancer \ntherapeutics. Local delivery methods enable high dose delivery while avoiding systemic exposure. \nBBB disruption with focused ultrasound and microbubbles offers local and noninvasive treatment. \nClinical trials show the prospects of these technologies and point to challenges for the future.\nThe blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) present in brain capillaries poses a formidable challenge for \ndelivery of therapeutics to treat a wide array of diseases affecting the brain (e.g., primary \nand secondary brain tumors, neurodegenerative diseases, lysosomal storage disorders, \ninfections) [1\u20133]. As a consequence of the BBB, drugs which may be otherwise effective \ncannot be utilized, require invasive delivery methods or have limited efficacy as well as side \neffects resulting from the use of large dosages.\nThe BBB phenotype is altered in many CNS diseases (see [4] for an extensive list) which \ncan have important implications for drug delivery. In the context of brain cancer, a \nproangiogenic environment yields blood vessels with a disorganized endothelium and \naltered blood flow which can reduce perfusion of affected tumor regions [5,6]. Hyper-\npermeability of the tumor vasculature is often observed as a result of increased paracellular \nflux due to loss of tight junctions as well as increased fenestrations and transcytotic vesicles \nin endothelial cells (ECs) [5,6]. The heterogeneous permeability of the BBB in tumors can \nreportedly limit drug efficacy [7,8]. A recent study found that the measured concentration of \nsystemically administered capecitabine or lapatinib within intracranial tumors was variable \n*Author for correspondence: Tel.: +1 617 353 7366, Fax: +1 617 353 5866, tmp@bu.edu. \nFinancial & competing interests disclosure\nThe authors have no other relevant affiliations or financial involvement with any organization or entity with a financial interest in or \nfinancial conflict with the subject matter or materials discussed in the manuscript apart from those disclosed.\nNo writing assistance was utilized in the production of this manuscript.\nHHS Public Access\nAuthor manuscript\nTher Deliv.
