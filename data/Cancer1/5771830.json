    "title": "Glycosylation Changes in Brain Cancer",
    "abstract": "Protein glycosylation is a posttranslational modification that affects more than half of all known \nproteins. Glycans covalently bound to biomolecules modulate their functions by both direct \ninteractions, such as the recognition of glycan structures by binding partners, and indirect \nmechanisms that contribute to the control of protein conformation, stability, and turnover. The \nfocus of this review is the discussion of aberrant glycosylation related to brain cancer. Altered \nsialylation and fucosylation of N- and O-glycans play a role in the development and progression of \nbrain cancer. Additionally, aberrant O-glycan expression has been implicated in brain cancer. This \nreview also addresses the clinical potential and applications of aberrant glycosylation for the \ndetection and treatment of brain cancer. The viable roles glycans may play in the development of \nbrain cancer therapeutics are addressed as well as cancer-glycoproteomics and personalized \nmedicine. Glycoprotein alterations are considered as a hallmark of cancer while high expression in \nbody fluids represents an opportunity for cancer assessment.\nGraphical abstract\n*Corresponding Author: Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX 79409-1061, \nyehia.mechref@ttu.edu, Tel: 806-742-3059, Fax: 806-742-1289. \nAuthor Contributions\nAll Authors were involved in the writing and proofreading of the document.
