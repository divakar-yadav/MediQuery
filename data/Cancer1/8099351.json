    "description": "Introduction\n      Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an incurable form of adult brain cancer with a dismal patient prognosis. Limited therapeutic options are available for GBMs as they are often detected late, they are highly infiltrative, and they display significant inter- and intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity (Aldape et\u00a0al., 2019). Many GBM driver mutations have been identified following genome-wide sequencing. The PI3K- and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-associated signaling pathways are frequently co-activated in GBM through activation or amplification of EGFR or PDGFRA and are often accompanied by mutation of the tumor suppressors NF1, TP53, and/or PTEN (Brennan et\u00a0al., 2013).\n      GBMs also display heterogeneity in their transcriptional circuits and epigenetic landscapes. Three major transcriptional signatures of GBM have been reported: proneural (PN), classical (CL), and mesenchymal (MES) (Verhaak et\u00a0al., 2010; Wang et\u00a0al., 2017). However, individual GBM tumors contain mixtures of cells with each of these subtype signatures, and the proportion of cells with each subtype can shift upon disease relapse following therapy (Brennan et\u00a0al., 2013; Neftel et\u00a0al., 2019; Patel et\u00a0al., 2014; Wang et\u00a0al., 2017). Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and lineage tracing studies have indicated that GBM cells can display plasticity and transit between cell states, suggesting that the tumor microenvironment (TME), as well as genetic and neurodevelopmental programs, may influence these transcriptional signatures (Neftel et\u00a0al., 2019). GBM subtypes should not, therefore, be viewed as stable, distinct disease entities; rather, they reflect different proportions of various cell states that can shift throughout tumor development.\n      Neftel et\u00a0al. (2019) have proposed four distinct tumor cell states in GBM: three of these\u2014neural stem cell-like, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell-like, and astrocyte-like\u2014 mirror cell types within a neurodevelopmental differentiation hierarchy. However, a fourth cell state, termed \u201cmesenchymal-like,\u201d does not seem to correspond to a specific cell type. The mesenchymal GBM subtype has the poorest survival rates and displays increased immune infiltration within the TME, relative to other subtypes (Wang et\u00a0al., 2017). This increased immune infiltrate correlates with loss of NF1; however, this is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain the emergence of a mesenchymal signature (Verhaak et\u00a0al., 2010), suggesting additional processes must contribute to the development of an immunosuppressive TME. Understanding the etiology of the GBM mesenchymal-like cell state and the origins of its associated transcriptional subtype will be important for elucidating mechanisms of immune evasion (Lim et\u00a0al., 2018).\n      Mechanisms underpinning the establishment of a pro-tumorigenic immune microenvironment in GBM remain unclear. To date, a lack of tractable and immunocompetent models of GBM have hampered efforts to dissect the relationship between GBM and the TME and the relative contribution of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental perturbations in directing tumor cell states. Here, we address the origins and mechanisms of immune evasion phenotypes in mesenchymal GBM by engineering a set of isogenic mouse GBM-initiating cells. Serial transplantation of transformed cells through syngeneic, immunocompetent hosts allowed us to monitor and dissect the progressive transcriptional and epigenetic changes that occur as GBM cells acquire immune evasion capabilities.\n      Our findings reveal a mechanism involving epigenetic immunoediting, in which exposure to immune attack leads to stable changes in transcriptional circuits, including critical myeloid-affiliated transcription factors and other immune-related pathways, in GBM cells. This occurs in the absence of clonal genetic selection and is likely enforced by sustained signaling from recruited tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). These acquired transcriptional circuits are stabilized by epigenetic changes and, therefore, persist in tumor cell descendants. We demonstrate that this leads to remodeling of the TME and the establishment of a protumorigenic microenvironment.\nResults\n      \n        Engineered GSCs acquire immune evasion capabilities upon serial transplantation through immunocompetent hosts\n        GBM is driven by cells with neural stem cell (NSC) characteristics (Lathia et\u00a0al., 2015). Genetically engineered mouse models and genome analysis of patient samples indicates that endogenous NSCs can be a cell-of-origin for GBM (Alcantara Llaguno et\u00a0al., 2016; Lee et\u00a0al., 2018). We, therefore, engineered a set of isogenic GBM stem cells (GSCs) from NSCs isolated from C57BL/6\u00a0J (BL6) mice, by introducing one of five well established genetic GBM driver mutations: EGFRvIII or PDGFRA overexpression or CRISPR/Cas-mediated ablation of Nf1, Pten, or Trp53 (Figures 1A and S1A\u2013S1G; Table S1; Bressan et\u00a0al., 2017; Conti et\u00a0al., 2005; Robertson et\u00a0al., 2019). These \u201csingle hit\u201d knockout GSCs expressed typical NSC markers (NESTIN and SOX2) and maintained the ability to differentiate into neurons and astrocytes (Figure\u00a0S1H).Figure\u00a01Engineered GSCs acquire immune evasion capabilities upon serial transplantation through immunocompetent hosts(A) NSC isolation from BL6 mice and engineering of GBM driver mutations.(B) Immunoblots showing NF1 and PTEN expression in NP cells versus wild-type BL6 NSCs.(C) Immunoblot confirming overexpression of EGFRvIII in NPE cells.(D) Representative stereomicroscope images of GFP+ NPE tumors in NSG mice (whole brain live imaging; top, GFP; bottom, GFP/bright field [BF] overlay, n\u00a0= 15).(E) H&E staining of NPE tumors in NSG (upper panel), scale bar, 50\u00a0\u03bcm; immunofluorescence of common NSC (GFAP/Nestin) and proliferation (Ki67) markers in NPE tumors (lower panel), scale bar, 20\u00a0\u03bcm.(F) Reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) analysis of common cancer driver pathways in wild-type BL6 NSCs versus mutant cell lines.(G) Representative bioluminescent imaging of NPE tumor progression in\u00a0vivo in BL6 recipients.

First, we created double mutant NSCs, via co-deletion of Nf1 and Pten (\u201cNP\u201d cells) (Figures 1A and 1B). These mutations occur together frequently in human mesenchymal GBM. Orthotopic transplantation of GFP+ NP cells into immunocompromised (NOD-scid-gamma [NSG]) mice led to the formation of small, benign growths (Figure\u00a0S1I). Only when further engineered with EGFRvIII overexpression\u2014forming a triple mutant cell line termed \u201cNPE\u201d (Figures 1A and 1C)\u2014did we observe extremely aggressive tumor growth and infiltration in\u00a0vivo (Figure\u00a01D) with the expected hallmarks of GBM (Figure\u00a01E). Concomitant mutation of Nf1 and Pten alongside EGFRvIII overexpression (termed NPE-Multiplex [NPE-Mx]) in an independent BL6 NSC line confirmed the requirement of this triple combination for tumor formation (Figures S1J\u2013S1L). We also generated a tumor-initiating cell line corresponding to the proneural subtype, termed \u201cPPP,\u201d with PDGFRA overexpression alongside Trp53 and Pten mutations (Figures S1M\u2013S1O). PPP tumor models were much less aggressive than their NPE counterparts (Figures S1P and S1Q).\n        Reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) analysis confirmed the expected activation of both RTK and PI3K signaling pathways in mutant NSCs, including elevated ERK, Ras, Raf, mTor, Akt, and Src expression (Figure\u00a01F). We noted differences between NPE and PPP cells, with EGFRvIII overexpression stimulating increased pERK and STAT3 expression in the NPE mesenchymal model, consistent with previous reports in human tumors (Carro et\u00a0al., 2010). The proneural subtype of GBM is known to have a reduced immune infiltrate and a less immunosuppressive TME (Wang et\u00a0al., 2017). Given this, and the much more aggressive nature of NPE cells and their correspondence to the most immune evasive mesenchymal GBM subtype, we decided to\u00a0focus on the NPE model to explore immune evasion mechanisms.\n        We confirmed that NPE cells are tumorigenic in immunocompetent, syngeneic BL6 hosts (Figures 1G and 1H), allowing us to model interactions between GBM cells and the immune TME. Tumors formed in parallel in immunocompromised NSG mice served as an important reference control (Figure\u00a01I). Indeed, in contrast to the \u223c3-week survival observed in all NSG hosts, NPE tumors arose in BL6 mice at a slower rate than in NSG mice (25\u201350\u00a0days versus 15\u201320\u00a0days, respectively) (Figure\u00a01J, yellow curve versus orange curve), and the majority of BL6 hosts survived long-term, with no detectable tumor (Figures 1G). These data are consistent with the BL6 host immune system responding to NPE cells and constraining their tumor formation.\n        We reasoned that cells with acquired immune evasion capabilities may be enriched by deriving primary GSC cultures from tumors that evade immune surveillance in BL6 mice following serial transplantation of these through fresh hosts. We therefore established fresh cultures from the NPE tumors of BL6 mice (termed NPE-BL6-TD [tumor-derived]) (Figure\u00a01I). NPE-BL6-TD cells in\u00a0vitro retained expression of NSC markers and contained no contaminating CD45+ immune cell populations (Figure\u00a0S1R). NPE-BL6-TD cells were transplanted into fresh, secondary BL6 recipients (Figure\u00a01I) and formed tumors with increased frequency (Figures 1J, light purple curve, and S1S). GSC cultures re-derived from these secondary tumors (herein termed NPE-IE [immune evasive]) were then transplanted into fresh BL6 hosts (tertiary recipients) (Figure\u00a01I). BL6 mice transplanted with NPE-IE cells displayed increased tumor formation with significantly worse survival than previously transplanted lines (Figures 1J, dark purple curve, and S1S). However, NPE and NPE-IE cells showed similar tumorigenicity when transplanted in control NSG mice, and we detected no proliferative advantage for NPE-IE cells in\u00a0vitro or evident genomic instability (Figures 1J, green curve versus orange curve, S1T, and S1U). Together, these results indicate that NPE-IE cells have acquired immune evasion capabilities, which accounts for their increased tumor formation in BL6 recipients. This is consistent with a form of immunoediting (Schreiber et\u00a0al., 2011), whereby sustained immune attack leads to the emergence of cells with increased ability to evade immune surveillance.\n      \n      \n        Immune evasive NPE-IE tumors possess a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment\n        To confirm if the NPE-IE tumors were more aggressive due to an ability to escape from T\u00a0cell clearance, we depleted CD8 T\u00a0cell populations in BL6 mice with NPE, NPE-BL6-TD, and NPE-IE tumors (Figure\u00a0S2A). In all cases, we observed accelerated tumor growth and a progressive increase in tumor penetrance. This confirms that tumors generated from the NPE line and its derivatives do not undergo antigen loss, and they remain under considerable pressure from CD8 T\u00a0cell-mediated clearance, from which they are actively escaping.Figure\u00a0S2Immune profiling of NPE and NPE-IE tumors reveals recapitulation of human disease and dynamic immune populations, related to Figure\u00a02(A) Survival analysis of BL6 mice orthotopically injected with NPE (left), NPE-BL6-TD (center) or NPE-IE (right) cells and subjected to IP injection of anti-CD8 or isotype matched control (IgG2b).

In tumor-bearing brains, we observed major changes in the total brain immune cell repertoire (Figures 2A\u20132D, S2B, and S2C), including a significant increase in macrophages and CD8/CD4 T\u00a0cells, markers of both M1- and M2-like macrophages, and an apparent decrease in microglia. Further, we observed lymphoid populations in tumor-bearing brains display markers of dysfunction, such as PD-1 and TIM3 expression (Figure\u00a0S2D). Importantly, fluorescent immunohistochemistry of tumor and adjacent tissue suggested that the dominating macrophage populations (F4/80+Iba1+) are localized to the tumor mass and are not generally increased throughout the brain (Figures 2E, 2F, S2E, and S2F).Figure\u00a02Whole brain immune population profiling reveals recapitulation of human GBM(A) Multi-parametric flow cytometry uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) of immune cell populations (CD45+) in whole brains of non-transplanted BL6 mice versus those with NPE or NPE-IE tumors; n\u00a0= 4 brains per condition.(B) Quantification of macrophage (left) and microglia (right) populations in (A).(C) Quantification of CD8 T\u00a0cell (left), CD4 Treg (center), and FOXP3\u2212 CD4 T\u00a0cell populations in (A).(D) Multi-parametric flow cytometry UMAP of myeloid populations (CD45+/CD11b+) in whole brains of non-transplanted BL6 mice versus those with NPE or NPE-IE tumors; n\u00a0= 4 per condition.(E) Representative fluorescent IHC of macrophage populations (F4/80+, Iba1+) in NPE or NPE-IE tumors/adjacent tissue; (n\u00a0= 3\u20135 per condition), scale bar, 200\u00a0\u03bcm.(F) Quantification of Iba1+ F4/80+ populations in (E) shown as frequency per mm2. One-way ANOVA, n\u00a0= 3\u20135 brains from each condition analyzed.See also Figure\u00a0S2.\n        We directly isolated the tumor mass to further characterize the tumor immune microenvironment. Multiparametric flow cytometry data revealed increased immune cell infiltration in NPE-IE tumors relative to NPE tumors (Figures 3A, 3B, S3A, and S3B). Importantly, there was a significant increase in monocytic-myeloid derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) and macrophages in NPE-IE tumors (Figures 3C and 3D), with tumor-infiltrating macrophages expressing significantly higher levels of PD-L1 than microglia (Figures 3E and S3C). We did not observe evidence of a phenotypic macrophage switch in NPE-IE tumors when compared with NPE tumors; rather, macrophages in each case displayed classical phagocytic and antigen presenting phenotypes (i.e., CD86+ and CD11c+, Figure\u00a0S3D), alongside the immunosuppressive marker PD-L1 (Figures 3E and S3E). There were no major changes noted in natural killer (NK) or dendritic cell populations (Figures S3F\u2013S3H).Figure\u00a03Immune evasive NPE-IE tumors possess a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment(A) Fast interpolation-based t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding (FIt-SNE) maps of cell populations in NPE and NPE-IE tumors.(B) Quantification of cell population frequencies in (A) as proportion of total live cell population (n\u00a0= 4 per condition).(C) Flt-SNE maps of myeloid (CD11b+) cells in NPE and NPE-IE tumors.(D) Quantification of macrophage, M-MDSCs, and microglia frequency in (C) as proportion of total live cell population (n\u00a0= 4 per condition).(E) PD-L1 median fluorescent intensity (MFI) quantification on microglia and macrophages in NPE and NPE-IE tumors (n\u00a0= 4 per condition).(F) Bioluminescent imaging of NPE-IE tumor progression in BL6 in\u00a0vivo following intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of aCSF-1R or PBS.(G) Survival analysis of BL6 mice orthotopically injected with NPE-IE cells and subjected to i.p. injection of \u03b1CSF-1R (n\u00a0= 17) or PBS (n\u00a0= 11).(H) Quantification of CD8+/CD4+ T\u00a0cell population frequencies in NPE and NPE-IE tumors as a proportion of total live cell population in (A) (n\u00a0= 6 per condition).(I) Phenotypic marker expression of CD8+/CD4+ T\u00a0cell subsets from (A) (n\u00a0= 6 per condition).For Flt-SNE plots, data were generated from 150,000 live cells randomly sampled from 3 tumors per condition (50,000 live events shown per tumor).See also Figure\u00a0S3.Figure\u00a0S3Immune evasive NPE-IE tumors possess a highly immunosuppressive TME, related to Figure\u00a03(A) & (B) Gating strategy to define myeloid (A) and lymphoid (B) populations in NPE and NPE-IE tumors.(C) Representative histograms of PD-L1 expression on microglia and macrophages in NPE-IE tumors (linked to Figure\u00a03E).

To determine whether the increased macrophages recruited to NPE-IE tumors support immune evasion, we next depleted these cells in BL6 mice using a blocking antibody targeting CSF-1R. This resulted in increased survival and even clearance of large,\u00a0well-established NPE-IE tumors (Figures 3F and 3G).\u00a0There was no significant impact of this treatment in immunocompromised NSG transplanted controls (Figure\u00a0S3I). Thus, tumor-associated macrophages play a key role in sustaining the growth and immune evasive qualities of NPE-IE tumors in BL6 mice.\n        Although there was no significant difference in the frequency of various T\u00a0cell populations within NPE-IE tumors (Figure\u00a03H), we did identify an increase in both CD8 and CD4 T\u00a0cell populations positive for the markers PD-1 and LAG3 (Figure\u00a03I). This indicates that the NPE-IE TME exhibits an elevated state of T\u00a0cell dysfunction and enhanced immunosuppressive functions (Burugu et\u00a0al., 2018). As mentioned, macrophages in both tumor types were highly positive for expression of the PD-1 ligand, PD-L1 (Figure\u00a03E), and we found microglia were positive for expression of the LAG3 ligand, MHC-II (Figure\u00a02D), suggesting the presence of additional immunosuppressive pathways beyond TAM recruitment. Our analyses highlight the utility of these GBM models, which reflect the features and immune repertoire of human mesenchymal GBM. We find that NPE-derived tumors can progressively escape CD8 T\u00a0cell clearance and establish an increasingly myeloid-enriched and pro-tumorigenic TME, with accompanying T\u00a0cell exhaustion.\n      \n      \n        Immune evasive cells undergo significant transcriptional reconfiguration following immune attack\n        To uncover the mechanism of acquired immune evasion observed in NPE-IE cells, we characterized their genome, transcriptome, and epigenome. Importantly, both karyotyping (Figure\u00a0S1U) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the NPE and NPE-IE cells revealed no significant genetic disruptions\u2014either ploidy, structural, or point mutations\u2014when compared to parental, wild-type NSCs (Figure\u00a0S4A). This suggests that it is not clonal evolution or classic genetic immunoediting processes that explain the acquired immune evasion properties observed in NPE-IE tumors. We reasoned that NPE-IE cells may have acquired other cell-intrinsic and stable changes in gene expression that support immune evasion.Figure\u00a0S4Transcriptional and epigenetic reconfiguration occurs across mouse samples, with DNA hypomethylation occurring at key immune-associated genes, related to Figures 4 and 5(A) WGS copy number heatmap of log2 ratios of coverage for NPE and NPE-IE lines demonstrates genetic stability of mouse lines (gain of chrX evident as CNVs were called against male reference).(B) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of RNA-seq data (top 500 most variable genes) for all cell line samples.(C) Heatmap of Z-scaled normalized counts for genes specific to all cell lines engineered with Nf1 loss ordered by log2 fold change (NF1 KO samples Vs. all others) (top).

Strikingly, of the single mutant lines, Nf1 loss stood out as having a transcriptome closest to the fully transformed NPE mutants (Figure\u00a0S4B). Nf1 loss alone revealed enrichment of several gene signatures relevant to GBM, including notable activation of angiogenic and cell migration pathways (Figure\u00a0S4C; Table S2). This is consistent with increased angiogenic signatures observed in the mesenchymal subtype (Verhaak et\u00a0al., 2010; Wang et\u00a0al., 2017) and suggests that loss of Nf1 may \u201cprime\u201d cells for malignant transformation.\n        Importantly, however, the immune evasive lines (NPE-BL6-TD and NPE-IE) acquired significantly different transcriptional patterns that were not explained by Nf1 loss alone; these included many immune-associated genes and Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Figures 4A\u20134C). We noted upregulation of several chemokines in NPE-IE cells (Figures 4D\u20134G; Table S3), particularly Ccl9, which has been previously linked to the establishment of pro-tumorigenic microenvironments (Kortlever et\u00a0al., 2017) and could explain the increased myeloid cell content of NPE-IE tumors. Another interesting candidate upregulated in cells derived from immunocompetent hosts was Irf8 (interferon regulatory factor 8) (Figure\u00a04B). Activation of Irf8 expression was surprising, because this is a myeloid-specific master transcription factor that is typically exclusively expressed in hematopoietic cells (Driggers et\u00a0al., 1990) and has known roles in myeloid lineage specification and macrophage differentiation (Holtschke et\u00a0al., 1996; Tamura et\u00a0al., 2000). Irf8 is normally silent in NSCs, thus, following immune attack, NPE cells can inappropriately \u201chijack\u201d expression of a myeloid master regulatory transcription factor. Together, these findings demonstrate that the in\u00a0vivo immune attack triggers significant transcriptional changes in NPE cells.Figure\u00a04Immune evasive cells undergo significant transcriptional reconfiguration following immune attack(A) PCA (principal component analysis) of mRNA-seq data (top 500 most variable genes) from NPE cells and derivative lines(B) Heatmap of Z scaled normalized counts for genes specific to NPE-BL6-TD and NPE-IE lines ordered by log2 fold change (NPE-BL6-TD and NPE-IE versus all others) (top).

We profiled genome-wide DNA methylation patterns using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). Principal-component analysis (PCA) analysis revealed three distinct groups (Figure\u00a05A), and we identified striking hypomethylation in cells transplanted in\u00a0vivo (Figures 5B and S4D). The NPE-BL6-TD and NPE-IE lines clustered particularly closely by PCA (Figure\u00a05A) and demonstrated widespread hypomethylation in comparison to NPE cells (Figure\u00a05C). Consistent with mRNA-seq data, we found many differentially demethylated genes in immune evasive cells were related to immune processes (Figures 5D and S4E).Figure\u00a05Immune evasion in NPE-IE lines is underpinned by epigenetic immunoediting(A) PCA of RRBS CpG methylation (top 25% most variable CpG sites).(B) Density heatmap of CpG methylation (%) across lines.(C) Density scatterplots of CpG methylation (%) (left) and differentially methylated region (DMR) bar plots (right) (red, hypermethylated DMRs; blue, hypomethylated DMRs) in NPE-BL6-TD and NPE-IE lines versus NPE (% DMR methylation change reported).(D) Rank plots of promoter DMRs (\u00b12 kb TSS) displaying hypomethylation in NPE-BL6-TD (top) and NPE-IE (bottom) versus NPE samples (DMRs with >50% methylation loss, overlapping genes within immune and interferon GO terms are highlighted in blue).(E) Mean CpG methylation (%) tracks for profiled samples around Irf8 transcriptional start site.See also Figure\u00a0S4.\n        One of the most significant differentially methylated regions occurred within the Irf8 promoter region and gene body, with methylation progressively erased in the NPE-BL6-TD and NPE-IE lines, consistent with increased transcriptional activation (Figures 5D, 5E, and S4F). These changes in DNA methylation patterns suggest a process of \u201cepigenetic immunoediting,\u201d in which transcriptional changes imposed by immune attack are stabilized and selected for in those cells with increased immune evasive qualities. This would lead to highly immune evasive and transcriptionally altered descendants. Interestingly, we identified methylation loss at other well-known immune evasion regulators, including Nt5e (CD73), and Cd274 (PDL1) (Figure\u00a0S4F), in line with these genes being primed for reactivation in\u00a0vivo. Indeed, we see transcriptional activation of Nt5e in the NPE-IE tumor cells (Figure\u00a0S4G), which has been recently identified as a critical GBM immunotherapy target that is elevated in TAMs (Goswami et\u00a0al., 2020).\n      \n      \n        Irf8 is responsive to interferon gamma and TAMs in NPE cells in\u00a0vitro and is important for immune evasion\n        Irf8 is known to be induced in macrophages via interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3)-induced STAT1 signaling (Contursi et\u00a0al., 2000). \u201cResponse to IFN\u03b3\u201d was an enriched GO term in the NPE-IE lines (Figure\u00a06A), so we postulated that chronic IFN\u03b3 signals from the immune TME (Mojic et\u00a0al., 2017) may stimulate activation of Irf8 expression in NPE cells. We tested this directly in\u00a0vitro by exposing immune-naive NPE cells to IFN\u03b3. Irf8 transcription was indeed activated in these cells, and we found that Irf8 can be stimulated more quickly and to higher levels in NPE-BL6-TD or NPE-IE cells following IFN\u03b3 treatment (Figures 6B, 6C, and S5A). This is consistent with priming for rapid transcriptional activation following DNA methylation loss at the Irf8 locus. Type I IFN signaling (induced by IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 treatment) was not capable of inducing expression of Irf8 to the same extent as IFN\u03b3 in immune-naive NPE cells in\u00a0vitro (Figure\u00a0S5B). Furthermore, the JAK/STAT inhibitor, tofacitinib, reversed expression of IRF8 in NPE cells but not in NPE-IE cells, suggesting a JAK/STAT-independent mechanism is operating in NPE-IE cells to sustain high Irf8 expression (Figure\u00a06D). Using an mCherry knockin reporter line for Irf8 expression, we confirmed that Irf8 transcription can be induced broadly in NPE cells following IFN\u03b3 treatment (Figures S5C and S5D). Moreover, profiling of directly isolated GFP+ NPE-BL6-TD and NPE-NSG-TD tumor cells confirmed activation of key genes occurs prior to in\u00a0vitro expansion (e.g., Irf8, H2-Ab1) (Figures 6E, S5E, and S5F). Exposure of NPE cells to an immunocompetent in\u00a0vivo environment is, therefore, sufficient to induce these observed transcriptional changes.Figure\u00a06Irf8 is responsive to IFN\u03b3 and TAMs in NPE cells in vitro and is important for immune evasion(A) GSEA of IFN\u03b3 response signature in NPE-IE cells (enrichment score [ES] and FDR reported).(B) RT-qPCR analysis of Irf8 expression in NPE, NPE-BL6-TD and NPE-IE cells in\u00a0vitro \u00b1 IFN\u03b3 treatment.(C) Representative immunoblot of IRF8 expression in NPE cell panel \u00b1 IFN\u03b3 time series treatment in\u00a0vitro (n\u00a0= 3).(D) Representative immunoblot of IRF8 and pSTAT1 expression in NPE cell panel with IFN\u03b3/Tofacitinib treatment in\u00a0vitro (n\u00a0= 3).(E) qRT-PCR analysis of Irf8 expression in NPE cells in\u00a0vitro versus GFP+ cells derived directly from NPE tumors in NSG/BL6 hosts.

Strikingly, our data revealed that infiltrating macrophage populations (F4/80+, CD45hi) can stimulate similar transcriptional changes in immune naive NPE cells to those observed in NPE-BL6-TD and NPE-IE cells (Figures 6G and S5G). This suggests that infiltrating macrophages could be the source of signals in\u00a0vivo, such as IFN\u03b3, driving this response. Further, although the proneural PPP cells did not generate tumors efficiently in\u00a0vivo or display immune evasion capabilities, we reasoned that PPP cells may still respond to the NPE tumor-derived immune cell co-culture, as in patient tumors the proneural subtype can shift to mesenchymal. In\u00a0vitro co-culture of PPP cells with immune cells isolated from NPE tumors suggested that similar transcriptional programs can be activated in proneural models (Figure\u00a0S5H), consistent with plasticity of subtype signatures reported by Neftel et\u00a0al., (2019).\n        We next generated NPE-IE Irf8 knockout cell lines. These showed a less aggressive phenotype, and tumors emerged with similar kinetics to mice transplanted with immune-naive NPE cells (Figures 6H, 6I, S5I, and S5J). Taken together, our data suggest that activation of Irf8 in our model is an important contributor to immune evasion in NPE-IE cells and may occur via IFN\u03b3-mediated activation in\u00a0vivo.\n      \n      \n        Human GSCs display two predominant transcriptional subtypes and mesenchymal GSCs are defined by IFN signaling\n        To assess whether our findings have relevance to human disease, we performed RNA-seq and molecular subtyping of 36 low passage, patient-derived GSC cultures, using non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) to identify key transcriptional meta-gene modules that distinguish them (Gaujoux and Seoighe, 2010; Figures S6A and S6B). By profiling GSCs expanded in\u00a0vitro, we can define potential immune-induced gene expression changes without the confounding contamination of immune cells within fresh tumor samples. Two distinct subtypes were identified: S1, which we termed the non-mesenchymal immune signature (Non-MESImm), and S2, which we termed the mesenchymal-immune signature (MESImm) (Figure\u00a07A). Enrichment of these meta-gene modules were associated with published signatures by Wang et\u00a0al. (2017), based on whole tumor transcriptomes (Figure\u00a07A, top panel). A distinct transcriptional profile was associated with the MESImm subtype that included GO terms associated with IFN signaling as a dominant feature (Figures 7B and 7C; Table S4).Figure\u00a0S6Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) of bulk RNA-seq in patient-derived GSCs identifies two distinct subtypes, related to Figure\u00a07(A) NMF of bulk RNA-seq highlights two predominant subgroups within patient-derived GBM GSCs.

Human IRF1 is also an IFN\u03b3-responsive transcription factor that has been reported to function alongside hIRF8 in the development of myeloid cells (Langlais et\u00a0al., 2016). Furthermore, we also identify increased expression of CCL2 in the MESImm signature, which may account for increased immune populations observed in mesenchymal GBM (Figures 7B and 7D; Qian et\u00a0al., 2011). Finally, we confirmed enrichment of this MESImm signature in our engineered NPE cells, which increased as the cell lines acquired immune evasion capabilities (i.e., NPE-IE cells) (Figure\u00a0S6C). Thus, related signatures to those uncovered in our mouse models are also observed in MESImm human GBMs. Importantly, these transcriptional signatures are stable and heritable in long term culture, in the absence of IFN signals; this is consistent with epigenetic events underlying a stable change to the transcriptome.\n        We validated our MESImm and Non-MESImm subtypes by comparing our findings with an analysis of independent, publicly available single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data (Neftel et\u00a0al., 2019). Similarly to human patient-derived GSC cultures, these GBM cells could be defined along a single axis of variation, separating MESImm and Non-MESImm cells. This axis was marked by expression of well-known mesenchymal genes such as CD44, CHI3L1, and VIM, as well as IFN-associated genes defined in the MESImm signature (Figure\u00a0S6D). MESImm cells were enriched for IFN GO terms, IFN associated genes, and IRF family members, and the MESImm signature was consistent with previously defined mesenchymal transcriptional subtypes (Figures S6E\u2013S6G and S7A; Wang et\u00a0al., 2017, 2019; Neftel et\u00a0al., 2019). This confirms that interferon-driven signatures are present within mesenchymal patient tumors.\n      \n      \n        Human MESImm GBMs display similar DNA methylation changes to NPE-IE cells\n        To assess if human GBMs enriched for the MESImm module may also have DNA methylation changes reflective of the mouse models, we profiled DNA methylation patterns in patient-derived GSCs and observed a decreased level of DNA methylation in the MESImm subtype (Figures 7E\u20137H). Furthermore, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) of our patient-derived GSCs demonstrated that low levels of DNA methylation observed in the MESImm subtype correlated with previously published mesenchymal signatures, as well as the signatures reported here, and could be associated with activation of relevant immune-related pathways such as IFN\u03b3 response (Figure\u00a0S7B). Notably, in the MESImm samples, we identified a loss of methylation specifically at CpG islands associated with those genes and pathways identified in our mouse models, including IRF1, CCL2, and IRF8 (Figures S7C and S7D). These findings are consistent with human GBM cells having undergone a similar process of transcriptional reconfiguration and epigenetic changes to those observed in the mouse models. Human GBMs may, therefore, also undergo epigenetic immunoediting to stabilize this immune evasive state, using similar mechanisms to those identified in the NPE-IE mouse cells.Figure\u00a0S7Comparison of the MESImm subtype with published subtypes across single cell data\u2014with hypomethylation evident in MESImm samples, related to Figure\u00a07(A) Heatmap of -log10 ssGSEA p values for subtypes across single cell RNA-seq cohort (Neftel et\u00a0al., 2019).(B) Scatterplot of ssGSEA enrichment scores and mean methylation (beta-values) for each sample (red: MESImm, blue: Non- MESImm), with correlation coefficients reported.(C) Genome tracks of key DMRs for IRF1, CCL2, and IRF8 (red: MESImm, blue: Non- MESImm).(D) Methylation (beta-value) at each CpG site within each corresponding DMR (trend lines denote LOESS curves).\nEngineered GSCs acquire immune evasion capabilities upon serial transplantation through immunocompetent hosts\n        GBM is driven by cells with neural stem cell (NSC) characteristics (Lathia et\u00a0al., 2015). Genetically engineered mouse models and genome analysis of patient samples indicates that endogenous NSCs can be a cell-of-origin for GBM (Alcantara Llaguno et\u00a0al., 2016; Lee et\u00a0al., 2018). We, therefore, engineered a set of isogenic GBM stem cells (GSCs) from NSCs isolated from C57BL/6\u00a0J (BL6) mice, by introducing one of five well established genetic GBM driver mutations: EGFRvIII or PDGFRA overexpression or CRISPR/Cas-mediated ablation of Nf1, Pten, or Trp53 (Figures 1A and S1A\u2013S1G; Table S1; Bressan et\u00a0al., 2017; Conti et\u00a0al., 2005; Robertson et\u00a0al., 2019).

First, we created double mutant NSCs, via co-deletion of Nf1 and Pten (\u201cNP\u201d cells) (Figures 1A and 1B). These mutations occur together frequently in human mesenchymal GBM. Orthotopic transplantation of GFP+ NP cells into immunocompromised (NOD-scid-gamma [NSG]) mice led to the formation of small, benign growths (Figure\u00a0S1I). Only when further engineered with EGFRvIII overexpression\u2014forming a triple mutant cell line termed \u201cNPE\u201d (Figures 1A and 1C)\u2014did we observe extremely aggressive tumor growth and infiltration in\u00a0vivo (Figure\u00a01D) with the expected hallmarks of GBM (Figure\u00a01E). Concomitant mutation of Nf1 and Pten alongside EGFRvIII overexpression (termed NPE-Multiplex [NPE-Mx]) in an independent BL6 NSC line confirmed the requirement of this triple combination for tumor formation (Figures S1J\u2013S1L). We also generated a tumor-initiating cell line corresponding to the proneural subtype, termed \u201cPPP,\u201d with PDGFRA overexpression alongside Trp53 and Pten mutations (Figures S1M\u2013S1O). PPP tumor models were much less aggressive than their NPE counterparts (Figures S1P and S1Q).\n        Reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) analysis confirmed the expected activation of both RTK and PI3K signaling pathways in mutant NSCs, including elevated ERK, Ras, Raf, mTor, Akt, and Src expression (Figure\u00a01F). We noted differences between NPE and PPP cells, with EGFRvIII overexpression stimulating increased pERK and STAT3 expression in the NPE mesenchymal model, consistent with previous reports in human tumors (Carro et\u00a0al., 2010). The proneural subtype of GBM is known to have a reduced immune infiltrate and a less immunosuppressive TME (Wang et\u00a0al., 2017). Given this, and the much more aggressive nature of NPE cells and their correspondence to the most immune evasive mesenchymal GBM subtype, we decided to\u00a0focus on the NPE model to explore immune evasion mechanisms.\n        We confirmed that NPE cells are tumorigenic in immunocompetent, syngeneic BL6 hosts (Figures 1G and 1H), allowing us to model interactions between GBM cells and the immune TME. Tumors formed in parallel in immunocompromised NSG mice served as an important reference control (Figure\u00a01I). Indeed, in contrast to the \u223c3-week survival observed in all NSG hosts, NPE tumors arose in BL6 mice at a slower rate than in NSG mice (25\u201350\u00a0days versus 15\u201320\u00a0days, respectively) (Figure\u00a01J, yellow curve versus orange curve), and the majority of BL6 hosts survived long-term, with no detectable tumor (Figures 1G). These data are consistent with the BL6 host immune system responding to NPE cells and constraining their tumor formation.\n        We reasoned that cells with acquired immune evasion capabilities may be enriched by deriving primary GSC cultures from tumors that evade immune surveillance in BL6 mice following serial transplantation of these through fresh hosts. We therefore established fresh cultures from the NPE tumors of BL6 mice (termed NPE-BL6-TD [tumor-derived]) (Figure\u00a01I). NPE-BL6-TD cells in\u00a0vitro retained expression of NSC markers and contained no contaminating CD45+ immune cell populations (Figure\u00a0S1R). NPE-BL6-TD cells were transplanted into fresh, secondary BL6 recipients (Figure\u00a01I) and formed tumors with increased frequency (Figures 1J, light purple curve, and S1S). GSC cultures re-derived from these secondary tumors (herein termed NPE-IE [immune evasive]) were then transplanted into fresh BL6 hosts (tertiary recipients) (Figure\u00a01I). BL6 mice transplanted with NPE-IE cells displayed increased tumor formation with significantly worse survival than previously transplanted lines (Figures 1J, dark purple curve, and S1S). However, NPE and NPE-IE cells showed similar tumorigenicity when transplanted in control NSG mice, and we detected no proliferative advantage for NPE-IE cells in\u00a0vitro or evident genomic instability (Figures 1J, green curve versus orange curve, S1T, and S1U). Together, these results indicate that NPE-IE cells have acquired immune evasion capabilities, which accounts for their increased tumor formation in BL6 recipients. This is consistent with a form of immunoediting (Schreiber et\u00a0al., 2011), whereby sustained immune attack leads to the emergence of cells with increased ability to evade immune surveillance.\nImmune evasive NPE-IE tumors possess a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment\n        To confirm if the NPE-IE tumors were more aggressive due to an ability to escape from T\u00a0cell clearance, we depleted CD8 T\u00a0cell populations in BL6 mice with NPE, NPE-BL6-TD, and NPE-IE tumors (Figure\u00a0S2A). In all cases, we observed accelerated tumor growth and a progressive increase in tumor penetrance. This confirms that tumors generated from the NPE line and its derivatives do not undergo antigen loss, and they remain under considerable pressure from CD8 T\u00a0cell-mediated clearance, from which they are actively escaping.Figure\u00a0S2Immune profiling of NPE and NPE-IE tumors reveals recapitulation of human disease and dynamic immune populations, related to Figure\u00a02(A) Survival analysis of BL6 mice orthotopically injected with NPE (left), NPE-BL6-TD (center) or NPE-IE (right) cells and subjected to IP injection of anti-CD8 or isotype matched control (IgG2b).

In tumor-bearing brains, we observed major changes in the total brain immune cell repertoire (Figures 2A\u20132D, S2B, and S2C), including a significant increase in macrophages and CD8/CD4 T\u00a0cells, markers of both M1- and M2-like macrophages, and an apparent decrease in microglia. Further, we observed lymphoid populations in tumor-bearing brains display markers of dysfunction, such as PD-1 and TIM3 expression (Figure\u00a0S2D). Importantly, fluorescent immunohistochemistry of tumor and adjacent tissue suggested that the dominating macrophage populations (F4/80+Iba1+) are localized to the tumor mass and are not generally increased throughout the brain (Figures 2E, 2F, S2E, and S2F).Figure\u00a02Whole brain immune population profiling reveals recapitulation of human GBM(A) Multi-parametric flow cytometry uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) of immune cell populations (CD45+) in whole brains of non-transplanted BL6 mice versus those with NPE or NPE-IE tumors; n\u00a0= 4 brains per condition.(B) Quantification of macrophage (left) and microglia (right) populations in (A).(C) Quantification of CD8 T\u00a0cell (left), CD4 Treg (center), and FOXP3\u2212 CD4 T\u00a0cell populations in (A).(D) Multi-parametric flow cytometry UMAP of myeloid populations (CD45+/CD11b+) in whole brains of non-transplanted BL6 mice versus those with NPE or NPE-IE tumors; n\u00a0= 4 per condition.(E) Representative fluorescent IHC of macrophage populations (F4/80+, Iba1+) in NPE or NPE-IE tumors/adjacent tissue; (n\u00a0= 3\u20135 per condition), scale bar, 200\u00a0\u03bcm.(F) Quantification of Iba1+ F4/80+ populations in (E) shown as frequency per mm2.

Multiparametric flow cytometry data revealed increased immune cell infiltration in NPE-IE tumors relative to NPE tumors (Figures 3A, 3B, S3A, and S3B). Importantly, there was a significant increase in monocytic-myeloid derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) and macrophages in NPE-IE tumors (Figures 3C and 3D), with tumor-infiltrating macrophages expressing significantly higher levels of PD-L1 than microglia (Figures 3E and S3C). We did not observe evidence of a phenotypic macrophage switch in NPE-IE tumors when compared with NPE tumors; rather, macrophages in each case displayed classical phagocytic and antigen presenting phenotypes (i.e., CD86+ and CD11c+, Figure\u00a0S3D), alongside the immunosuppressive marker PD-L1 (Figures 3E and S3E). There were no major changes noted in natural killer (NK) or dendritic cell populations (Figures S3F\u2013S3H).Figure\u00a03Immune evasive NPE-IE tumors possess a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment(A) Fast interpolation-based t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding (FIt-SNE) maps of cell populations in NPE and NPE-IE tumors.(B) Quantification of cell population frequencies in (A) as proportion of total live cell population (n\u00a0= 4 per condition).(C) Flt-SNE maps of myeloid (CD11b+) cells in NPE and NPE-IE tumors.(D) Quantification of macrophage, M-MDSCs, and microglia frequency in (C) as proportion of total live cell population (n\u00a0= 4 per condition).(E) PD-L1 median fluorescent intensity (MFI) quantification on microglia and macrophages in NPE and NPE-IE tumors (n\u00a0= 4 per condition).(F) Bioluminescent imaging of NPE-IE tumor progression in BL6 in\u00a0vivo following intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of aCSF-1R or PBS.(G) Survival analysis of BL6 mice orthotopically injected with NPE-IE cells and subjected to i.p. injection of \u03b1CSF-1R (n\u00a0= 17) or PBS (n\u00a0= 11).(H) Quantification of CD8+/CD4+ T\u00a0cell population frequencies in NPE and NPE-IE tumors as a proportion of total live cell population in (A) (n\u00a0= 6 per condition).(I) Phenotypic marker expression of CD8+/CD4+ T\u00a0cell subsets from (A) (n\u00a0= 6 per condition).For Flt-SNE plots, data were generated from 150,000 live cells randomly sampled from 3 tumors per condition (50,000 live events shown per tumor).See also Figure\u00a0S3.Figure\u00a0S3Immune evasive NPE-IE tumors possess a highly immunosuppressive TME, related to Figure\u00a03(A) & (B) Gating strategy to define myeloid (A) and lymphoid (B) populations in NPE and NPE-IE tumors.(C) Representative histograms of PD-L1 expression on microglia and macrophages in NPE-IE tumors (linked to Figure\u00a03E).

To determine whether the increased macrophages recruited to NPE-IE tumors support immune evasion, we next depleted these cells in BL6 mice using a blocking antibody targeting CSF-1R. This resulted in increased survival and even clearance of large,\u00a0well-established NPE-IE tumors (Figures 3F and 3G).\u00a0There was no significant impact of this treatment in immunocompromised NSG transplanted controls (Figure\u00a0S3I). Thus, tumor-associated macrophages play a key role in sustaining the growth and immune evasive qualities of NPE-IE tumors in BL6 mice.\n        Although there was no significant difference in the frequency of various T\u00a0cell populations within NPE-IE tumors (Figure\u00a03H), we did identify an increase in both CD8 and CD4 T\u00a0cell populations positive for the markers PD-1 and LAG3 (Figure\u00a03I). This indicates that the NPE-IE TME exhibits an elevated state of T\u00a0cell dysfunction and enhanced immunosuppressive functions (Burugu et\u00a0al., 2018). As mentioned, macrophages in both tumor types were highly positive for expression of the PD-1 ligand, PD-L1 (Figure\u00a03E), and we found microglia were positive for expression of the LAG3 ligand, MHC-II (Figure\u00a02D), suggesting the presence of additional immunosuppressive pathways beyond TAM recruitment. Our analyses highlight the utility of these GBM models, which reflect the features and immune repertoire of human mesenchymal GBM. We find that NPE-derived tumors can progressively escape CD8 T\u00a0cell clearance and establish an increasingly myeloid-enriched and pro-tumorigenic TME, with accompanying T\u00a0cell exhaustion.\nImmune evasive cells undergo significant transcriptional reconfiguration following immune attack\n        To uncover the mechanism of acquired immune evasion observed in NPE-IE cells, we characterized their genome, transcriptome, and epigenome. Importantly, both karyotyping (Figure\u00a0S1U) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the NPE and NPE-IE cells revealed no significant genetic disruptions\u2014either ploidy, structural, or point mutations\u2014when compared to parental, wild-type NSCs (Figure\u00a0S4A). This suggests that it is not clonal evolution or classic genetic immunoediting processes that explain the acquired immune evasion properties observed in NPE-IE tumors. We reasoned that NPE-IE cells may have acquired other cell-intrinsic and stable changes in gene expression that support immune evasion.Figure\u00a0S4Transcriptional and epigenetic reconfiguration occurs across mouse samples, with DNA hypomethylation occurring at key immune-associated genes, related to Figures 4 and 5(A) WGS copy number heatmap of log2 ratios of coverage for NPE and NPE-IE lines demonstrates genetic stability of mouse lines (gain of chrX evident as CNVs were called against male reference).(B) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of RNA-seq data (top 500 most variable genes) for all cell line samples.(C) Heatmap of Z-scaled normalized counts for genes specific to all cell lines engineered with Nf1 loss ordered by log2 fold change (NF1 KO samples Vs. all others) (top).

Strikingly, of the single mutant lines, Nf1 loss stood out as having a transcriptome closest to the fully transformed NPE mutants (Figure\u00a0S4B). Nf1 loss alone revealed enrichment of several gene signatures relevant to GBM, including notable activation of angiogenic and cell migration pathways (Figure\u00a0S4C; Table S2). This is consistent with increased angiogenic signatures observed in the mesenchymal subtype (Verhaak et\u00a0al., 2010; Wang et\u00a0al., 2017) and suggests that loss of Nf1 may \u201cprime\u201d cells for malignant transformation.\n        Importantly, however, the immune evasive lines (NPE-BL6-TD and NPE-IE) acquired significantly different transcriptional patterns that were not explained by Nf1 loss alone; these included many immune-associated genes and Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Figures 4A\u20134C). We noted upregulation of several chemokines in NPE-IE cells (Figures 4D\u20134G; Table S3), particularly Ccl9, which has been previously linked to the establishment of pro-tumorigenic microenvironments (Kortlever et\u00a0al., 2017) and could explain the increased myeloid cell content of NPE-IE tumors. Another interesting candidate upregulated in cells derived from immunocompetent hosts was Irf8 (interferon regulatory factor 8) (Figure\u00a04B). Activation of Irf8 expression was surprising, because this is a myeloid-specific master transcription factor that is typically exclusively expressed in hematopoietic cells (Driggers et\u00a0al., 1990) and has known roles in myeloid lineage specification and macrophage differentiation (Holtschke et\u00a0al., 1996; Tamura et\u00a0al., 2000). Irf8 is normally silent in NSCs, thus, following immune attack, NPE cells can inappropriately \u201chijack\u201d expression of a myeloid master regulatory transcription factor. Together, these findings demonstrate that the in\u00a0vivo immune attack triggers significant transcriptional changes in NPE cells.Figure\u00a04Immune evasive cells undergo significant transcriptional reconfiguration following immune attack(A) PCA (principal component analysis) of mRNA-seq data (top 500 most variable genes) from NPE cells and derivative lines(B) Heatmap of Z scaled normalized counts for genes specific to NPE-BL6-TD and NPE-IE lines ordered by log2 fold change (NPE-BL6-TD and NPE-IE versus all others) (top).

We profiled genome-wide DNA methylation patterns using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). Principal-component analysis (PCA) analysis revealed three distinct groups (Figure\u00a05A), and we identified striking hypomethylation in cells transplanted in\u00a0vivo (Figures 5B and S4D). The NPE-BL6-TD and NPE-IE lines clustered particularly closely by PCA (Figure\u00a05A) and demonstrated widespread hypomethylation in comparison to NPE cells (Figure\u00a05C). Consistent with mRNA-seq data, we found many differentially demethylated genes in immune evasive cells were related to immune processes (Figures 5D and S4E).Figure\u00a05Immune evasion in NPE-IE lines is underpinned by epigenetic immunoediting(A) PCA of RRBS CpG methylation (top 25% most variable CpG sites).(B) Density heatmap of CpG methylation (%) across lines.(C) Density scatterplots of CpG methylation (%) (left) and differentially methylated region (DMR) bar plots (right) (red, hypermethylated DMRs; blue, hypomethylated DMRs) in NPE-BL6-TD and NPE-IE lines versus NPE (% DMR methylation change reported).(D) Rank plots of promoter DMRs (\u00b12 kb TSS) displaying hypomethylation in NPE-BL6-TD (top) and NPE-IE (bottom) versus NPE samples (DMRs with >50% methylation loss, overlapping genes within immune and interferon GO terms are highlighted in blue).(E) Mean CpG methylation (%) tracks for profiled samples around Irf8 transcriptional start site.See also Figure\u00a0S4.\n        One of the most significant differentially methylated regions occurred within the Irf8 promoter region and gene body, with methylation progressively erased in the NPE-BL6-TD and NPE-IE lines, consistent with increased transcriptional activation (Figures 5D, 5E, and S4F). These changes in DNA methylation patterns suggest a process of \u201cepigenetic immunoediting,\u201d in which transcriptional changes imposed by immune attack are stabilized and selected for in those cells with increased immune evasive qualities. This would lead to highly immune evasive and transcriptionally altered descendants. Interestingly, we identified methylation loss at other well-known immune evasion regulators, including Nt5e (CD73), and Cd274 (PDL1) (Figure\u00a0S4F), in line with these genes being primed for reactivation in\u00a0vivo. Indeed, we see transcriptional activation of Nt5e in the NPE-IE tumor cells (Figure\u00a0S4G), which has been recently identified as a critical GBM immunotherapy target that is elevated in TAMs (Goswami et\u00a0al., 2020).\nHuman GSCs display two predominant transcriptional subtypes and mesenchymal GSCs are defined by IFN signaling\n        To assess whether our findings have relevance to human disease, we performed RNA-seq and molecular subtyping of 36 low passage, patient-derived GSC cultures, using non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) to identify key transcriptional meta-gene modules that distinguish them (Gaujoux and Seoighe, 2010; Figures S6A and S6B). By profiling GSCs expanded in\u00a0vitro, we can define potential immune-induced gene expression changes without the confounding contamination of immune cells within fresh tumor samples. Two distinct subtypes were identified: S1, which we termed the non-mesenchymal immune signature (Non-MESImm), and S2, which we termed the mesenchymal-immune signature (MESImm) (Figure\u00a07A). Enrichment of these meta-gene modules were associated with published signatures by Wang et\u00a0al. (2017), based on whole tumor transcriptomes (Figure\u00a07A, top panel). A distinct transcriptional profile was associated with the MESImm subtype that included GO terms associated with IFN signaling as a dominant feature (Figures 7B and 7C; Table S4).Figure\u00a0S6Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) of bulk RNA-seq in patient-derived GSCs identifies two distinct subtypes, related to Figure\u00a07(A) NMF of bulk RNA-seq highlights two predominant subgroups within patient-derived GBM GSCs.

Human IRF1 is also an IFN\u03b3-responsive transcription factor that has been reported to function alongside hIRF8 in the development of myeloid cells (Langlais et\u00a0al., 2016). Furthermore, we also identify increased expression of CCL2 in the MESImm signature, which may account for increased immune populations observed in mesenchymal GBM (Figures 7B and 7D; Qian et\u00a0al., 2011). Finally, we confirmed enrichment of this MESImm signature in our engineered NPE cells, which increased as the cell lines acquired immune evasion capabilities (i.e., NPE-IE cells) (Figure\u00a0S6C). Thus, related signatures to those uncovered in our mouse models are also observed in MESImm human GBMs. Importantly, these transcriptional signatures are stable and heritable in long term culture, in the absence of IFN signals; this is consistent with epigenetic events underlying a stable change to the transcriptome.\n        We validated our MESImm and Non-MESImm subtypes by comparing our findings with an analysis of independent, publicly available single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data (Neftel et\u00a0al., 2019). Similarly to human patient-derived GSC cultures, these GBM cells could be defined along a single axis of variation, separating MESImm and Non-MESImm cells. This axis was marked by expression of well-known mesenchymal genes such as CD44, CHI3L1, and VIM, as well as IFN-associated genes defined in the MESImm signature (Figure\u00a0S6D). MESImm cells were enriched for IFN GO terms, IFN associated genes, and IRF family members, and the MESImm signature was consistent with previously defined mesenchymal transcriptional subtypes (Figures S6E\u2013S6G and S7A; Wang et\u00a0al., 2017, 2019; Neftel et\u00a0al., 2019). This confirms that interferon-driven signatures are present within mesenchymal patient tumors.\nHuman MESImm GBMs display similar DNA methylation changes to NPE-IE cells\n        To assess if human GBMs enriched for the MESImm module may also have DNA methylation changes reflective of the mouse models, we profiled DNA methylation patterns in patient-derived GSCs and observed a decreased level of DNA methylation in the MESImm subtype (Figures 7E\u20137H). Furthermore, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) of our patient-derived GSCs demonstrated that low levels of DNA methylation observed in the MESImm subtype correlated with previously published mesenchymal signatures, as well as the signatures reported here, and could be associated with activation of relevant immune-related pathways such as IFN\u03b3 response (Figure\u00a0S7B). Notably, in the MESImm samples, we identified a loss of methylation specifically at CpG islands associated with those genes and pathways identified in our mouse models, including IRF1, CCL2, and IRF8 (Figures S7C and S7D). These findings are consistent with human GBM cells having undergone a similar process of transcriptional reconfiguration and epigenetic changes to those observed in the mouse models. Human GBMs may, therefore, also undergo epigenetic immunoediting to stabilize this immune evasive state, using similar mechanisms to those identified in the NPE-IE mouse cells.Figure\u00a0S7Comparison of the MESImm subtype with published subtypes across single cell data\u2014with hypomethylation evident in MESImm samples, related to Figure\u00a07(A) Heatmap of -log10 ssGSEA p values for subtypes across single cell RNA-seq cohort (Neftel et\u00a0al., 2019).(B) Scatterplot of ssGSEA enrichment scores and mean methylation (beta-values) for each sample (red: MESImm, blue: Non- MESImm), with correlation coefficients reported.(C) Genome tracks of key DMRs for IRF1, CCL2, and IRF8 (red: MESImm, blue: Non- MESImm).(D) Methylation (beta-value) at each CpG site within each corresponding DMR (trend lines denote LOESS curves).\nDiscussion\n      The specific combination of genetic, epigenetic, and microenvironmental cues that confers the varied transcriptional states observed in GBM cells remains poorly understood. Here, we have shown that a key component of the previously reported \u201cmesenchymal\u201d signature is a transcriptional module acquired in GBM cells following immune attack that is functionally important in facilitating immune evasion. Reconfigured transcription factor expression profiles and altered transcriptional circuits lead to the creation of an enhanced myeloid-enriched, immunosuppressive microenvironment, which is a feature of the most aggressive mesenchymal GBM subtype. This is accompanied by DNA methylation changes, and our results suggest a form of epigenetic immunoediting\u2014rather than sub-clonal genetic diversification and selection\u2014can support a striking gain in immune evasion capabilities. Similar transcriptional and DNA methylation changes are observed in human GBM cells of the mesenchymal subtype, suggesting this process of epigenetic immunoediting may occur in patients.\n      To date, there has been a lack of preclinical mouse models to explore mechanisms of immune evasion in GBM (Robertson et\u00a0al., 2019). The set of isogenic cells we report here enables rapid production of tumors that recapitulate hallmarks of human GBM, most notably the immune landscape, in syngeneic, immunocompetent mouse models. A range of immune evasion pathways that we identified in the mouse NPE models are relevant to human disease, primarily the recruitment of pro-tumorigenic myeloid cells, including tumor cell activation of CD73 (Goswami et\u00a0al., 2020) and markers of T\u00a0cell exhaustion such as PD-1 and LAG3 (Mohme and Neidert, 2020). Using these models, we have been able to dissect the transcriptional and epigenetic changes\u00a0that result from immune attack and identify mechanisms that then underpin acquired immune evasion. This has not been previously possible using human xenografts, primary tumor profiling, or existing syngeneic mouse models. NPE-IE cells are a renewable and easily shared primary cell line. The GFP-luciferase reporter enables tracking of tumor cells in live animals and facile recovery of tumor cells. This should be a useful model for the research community to deeply dissect GBM immune biology and support translational studies of immunotherapies.\n      We observed increased infiltration of macrophages with various phenotypes, which is consistent with recent reports that macrophages mount a multifaceted response in human GBM (Klemm et\u00a0al., 2020). Enrichment of M-MDSCs was evident in our NPE-IE model, and this myeloid progenitor population has been implicated in glioma progression and is known to be highly immunosuppressive (Mi et\u00a0al., 2020). Furthermore, we observed a phenotypic shift in the microglia populations present in tumor burdened brains, with MHC-II expression indicative of microglial activation. GBM is regarded as a relatively immunologically \u201ccold\u201d tumor, with its low mutational burden resulting in limited availability of neoantigens to support T\u00a0cell recognition and effective anti-tumor immunity. Consistent with human disease, the presence of NPE and NPE-IE tumors in mice leads to increased infiltration of both CD4+ immunosuppressive Treg cells and CD8+ T\u00a0cells into the brain, providing a unique opportunity to explore these populations in GBM. We find that T\u00a0cell populations display elevated co-expression of markers associated with exhaustion (PD-1, LAG3) and regulatory function (FOXP3, LAG3) in NPE-IE tumors, which is complimented by increased expression of PD-L1 and MHC-II (PD-1 and LAG3 ligands) on macrophages and microglia, respectively. These inhibitory pathways likely contribute to immune escape of NPE-IE tumors and may represent potential therapeutic targets either alone or in combination.\n      Our engineered GSCs were found to upregulate Irf8. Because Irf8 is normally restricted to myeloid cells, our findings demonstrate the ability of GSCs to hijack myeloid-related transcriptional modules for immune evasion and chemokine expression. The acquired ability of GSCs to secrete chemokines following extensive immune attack may explain the increased presence of immunosuppressive cells in the NPE-IE models as well as the MESImm GBM subtype, with both CCL2 and CCL9 previously implicated in the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes (Qian et\u00a0al., 2011; Kortlever et\u00a0al., 2017).\n      Because the engineered NPE lines remained genetically stable (we deliberately avoided mutation of Trp53), it is unlikely that genetic events, clonal selection, or classic genetic immunoediting can explain our observations. Instead, our data indicate the existence of a process of epigenetic immunoediting, whereby following exposure to an in\u00a0vivo environment and subsequently, immune attack, GSCs undergo site-specific DNA methylation changes alongside concomitant transcriptional changes that lead to activation of several immune-related signatures. The extent of these changes may vary across the tumor population, with selective pressures then enabling those with increased chemokine secretion to survive immune clearance following macrophage recruitment. The resulting reconfigured transcriptional circuits and modules are stabilized by DNA methylation changes, enhancing immune evasion.\n      Wang et\u00a0al. (2017) previously demonstrated the mesenchymal signatures of bulk tumors are tumor cell intrinsic and not simply a feature of contaminating immune cells or associated endothelial cells. However, it remained unclear how this signature is acquired, because, unlike other GBM subtypes, mesenchymal GBM does not reflect a normal neurodevelopmental state and is not precisely defined by specific genetic events\u2014although it clearly correlates with NF1 loss. Our findings do not diminish the importance of NF1 loss or related pathways in contributing to the mesenchymal subtype signature. Indeed, our Nf1\u2212/\u2212 NSCs clearly show profound transcriptional changes and upregulation of angiogenesis related pathways. Such GBM driver mutations are a prerequisite for tumorigenesis and help establish the TME. However, we clearly demonstrate using unbiased functional and mechanistic studies that immune attack itself is driving a major component of the changes required for effective immune evasion, and contributing key modules to the mesenchymal signature. Interestingly, we uncover a potential self-reinforcing feedback loop, wherein immune attack drives tumor cells to recruit myeloid cells, which in turn expose cells to even further increased IFN\u03b3. This ultimately results in stable epigenetic changes that are propagated in the expanding tumor population. These transcriptional changes are a functionally important component of immune evasion signatures in mesenchymal GBM cells. Further mechanistic dissection of this relationship, in particular the signals provided by the macrophages that drive this phenotype, may provide a framework to support development of TAM-targeting GBM therapies.\n      Therefore, we propose that Nf1 loss is a key mutation that primes NPE cells and facilitates the acquired transcriptional and epigenetic changes that occur in response to immune attack. This is supported by recent findings that Nf1\u2212/\u2212 neurons stimulate downstream T\u00a0cell and microglial activation that is essential for low-grade glioma growth (Guo et\u00a0al., 2020). The specific downstream events of Nf1 loss, and whether these effects are due to excessive MAPK signaling or other effector pathways, remain unknown. Our initial observations for wild-type NSCs suggests these cannot tolerate chronic IFN\u03b3 and will fail to expand in culture, whereas mutation of Nf1 can overcome this, suggesting it provides a key step in tolerating the subsequent transcriptional changes imposed by immune attack and associated epigenetic reconfigurations.\n      Based on our data, the specific signals that trigger the observed transcriptional signatures are likely to include IFN. IFN signaling has a well-recognized role in orchestrating anti-tumor\u00a0responses (Dunn et\u00a0al., 2006). However, our data support a model in which prolonged exposure to IFN\u03b3 may be subverted to the benefit of the tumor cells by facilitating the acquisition of a pro-tumorigenic TME. We show that IFN\u03b3 can drive similar transcriptional changes in NPE cells in\u00a0vitro, and many of the genes enriched in the NPE-IE cells are downstream effectors of this signaling pathway. However, we cannot rule out that there are contributions from other cytokines in\u00a0vivo, such as TNF\u03b1 (Bhat et\u00a0al., 2013).\n      Our data suggest that recruited TAMs may be a source of a sustained IFN\u03b3 signal; however, other immune cells are known to produce IFN\u03b3 and may also contribute. Interestingly, two recent studies have shown that IFN\u03b3 can diffuse over long-ranges, indicating that tumor cells may be exposed to IFN\u03b3 throughout the TME (Hoekstra et\u00a0al., 2020; Thibaut et\u00a0al., 2020). Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated the ability of in\u00a0vitro IFN\u03b3 exposure to lead to epigenome changes at the chromatin level (Benci et\u00a0al., 2016). It is likely that IFN\u03b3 is, therefore, a major inducer of the acquired immune evasive properties of NPE-IE cells. However, further studies will be needed to fully define the source, timing, and action of signals responsible for transcriptional changes imposed in tumor cells with the MESImm signature.\n      Overall, our findings suggest the observed gradient, or continuum, of subtype identities in GBM tumors can be explained by the extent to which the tumor immune microenvironment has eroded their epigenetic landscape and altered transcription factor regulatory networks. This may explain the detection of \u201chybrid\u201d states by Neftel et\u00a0al. (2019) that might represent partially edited states. It is also noteworthy that ECM and wound healing-associated gene sets correlate with the interferon signaling signatures in our MESImm subtype (data not shown), which is consistent with recent reports (Richards et\u00a0al., 2021). Activation of wound-healing signatures may relate to physiologically relevant transcriptional changes that occur in regeneration and repair, such as is seen in reactive astrocytosis. Taken together, this implies that the activation of wound healing or injury response programs may accompany the activation of immune/interferon-related pathways; however, whether these programs are related or co-dependent in the establishment of a mesenchymal phenotype remains unclear.\n      We conclude that transcriptional and epigenetic reconfiguration and the co-opting of myeloid lineage-specific transcription factors and transcriptional modules is a tumor cell-intrinsic response that occurs following immune attack in the TME. We propose this is exploited in GBM to avoid immune detection and clearance. It will be of great interest to determine if similar epigenetic immunoediting processes that we have identified here in GBM also operate in other brain tumors or carcinomas.\n      \n        Limitations of study\n        We acknowledge that WGS of more NPE-IE lines would allow us to more definitively rule out the effects of point mutations in driving the immune evasion response reported here. It will also be interesting to further dissect the contributions of different components of the TME on the plasticity of GBM cells using in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro assays. In particular, exploring the relative contribution of macrophage recruitment, retention, and polarization, as well as the roles of other immune cell populations, requires extensive further studies. Although our analysis of the human signatures is consistent with our conclusions, further direct testing of the influence of the immune cells or cytokines on their transcriptional state is necessary. Deeper characterization and testing of our proneural (PPP) model will be needed to determine how specific the pathways we identify here are to the mesenchymal subtype. Finally, our data strongly indicate a role for IFN\u03b3 in mediating the emergence of the mesenchymal-like signatures reported throughout our study, however, it will be necessary to confirm the effects of this cytokine and potentially others in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro.\nLimitations of study\n        We acknowledge that WGS of more NPE-IE lines would allow us to more definitively rule out the effects of point mutations in driving the immune evasion response reported here.

Additional code is available upon request.\n        \n      \n      \n        Experimental model and subject details\n        \n          Mice and in\u00a0vivo procedures\n          All treatments and procedures on mice were performed in accordance with protocols approved by Home Office UK guidelines in a designated facility under a project license to S.M.P., (PC0395462) at the University of Edinburgh. Mice were maintained on a regular diet in a pathogen-free facility on a 12-hr light/dark cycle with unlimited access to food and water. Intracranial transplantation of GSCs was performed using a stereotaxic frame to inject 200,000 cells resuspended in 2\u00a0\u03bcl of NSC media into 6- to 8-week-old male NOD/SCID/GAMMA (NSG) or C57BL/6 SCRM (BL6) mouse striatum, following administration of isoflourane general anesthesia and Rimadyl analgesic. Coordinates were 0.6mm anterior and 1.5mm lateral to the Bregma and 2.4\u00a0mm deep. Cell preparation and procedures were done as previously described in Pollard et\u00a0al. (2009). Bioluminescent imaging was performed 20\u00a0minutes after D-Luciferin (50\u00a0mg/kg) subcutaneous injection, using the IVIS Lumina LT Series III instrument (Perkin Elmer). For all antibody blocking experiments, animals were randomly assigned to test and control groups. Blocking antibodies for CD8, CSF1R and IgG2b were administered by intraperitoneal (IP) injection at doses and frequencies described in the method details.\n        \n        \n          Cell culture\n          \n            General cell culture\n            Mouse and human cells were cultured in serum-free basal medium supplemented with N2 and B27 (Life Technologies), laminin (Cultrex, 2\u00a0mg/ml) and growth factors EGF and FGF2 (Peprotech, 10\u00a0ng/ml). Cells were maintained as previously described in Pollard et\u00a0al. (2009).\n          \n        \n        \n          NSC differentiation to astrocytes\n          Cells were seeded 4\u00a0\u00d7 103 cells/ cm2 in NS culture media without EGF or FGF2 and with BMP4 (10\u00a0ng/ml). For neuronal differentiation we seeded cells at 8\u00a0\u00d7 103 cells/cm2 or 4\u00a0\u00d7 103 cells/cm2 for the BL6-NP and BL6-NPE in NS basal media without growth factors. Media was replenished every 3\u20104\u00a0days. Immunostaining for differentiation markers was carried out on day 3 for astrocytes, and day 10 for neurons, post-differentiation initiation.\n        \n        \n          Co-culture of NPE cells with tumor derived immune cells\n          3x104 NPE cells were seeded in NSC culture media in a 12-well plate at least 6 hours prior to introduction of immune cells to allow attachment. F4/80\u00a0+ and CD3+ immune cells were isolated from tumors and collected by flow (detailed below). F4/80\u00a0+ cells were resuspended in \u2018minimal macrophage media\u2019 (DMEM high glucose (GIBCO), 10% FBS (GIBCO), 1% pen/strep (GIBCO)) and CD3 cells were resuspended in \u2018minimal T\u00a0cell media\u2019 (complete RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO) containing 1% pen/strep (GIBCO), 50\u00a0\u03bcM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (GIBCO), and 1% L-glutamine (GIBCO)) before being seeded in a 3.0\u00a0\u03bcm pore polycarbonate membrane transwell insert (SLS, #3402) containing the appropriate medium. Co-culture experiments were carried out overnight (16 \u2013 20 hours).\n        \n        \n          Cell growth analysis\n          NPE and NPE-IE cells were seeded in NSC culture media in a 24-well plate and growth curves were determined using Incucyte (Essen Bioscience) live cell imaging system.\n        \n      \n      \n        Method details\n        \n          Design and construction of CRISPR sgRNAs and PiggyBac plasmids\n          For gene knockouts, two gRNAs were designed to remove or generate indels, these were introduced to the most disease relevant gene regions in the case of GBM drivers. CRISPR sgRNAs were designed using the Optimized CRISPR Design tool (https://zlab.bio/guide-design-resources). Sequences are provided in Table S1. For construction of sgRNA-encoding plasmids, single-stranded oligonucleodies (IDT) containing the guide sequence of the sgRNAs were annealed, phosphorylated and ligated into BsaI site of U6-BsaI-sgRNA backbone (kindly provided by S. Gerety, Sanger Institute) or U6-BbsI-CBh-Cas9-T2A-mCherry backbone (this was a gift from Ralf Kuehn, Addgene plasmid # 64324) (Chu et\u00a0al., 2015).\n          PiggyBac expression vectors were constructed via Gateway cloning apart from the EGFRvIII construct. The LUC-2A-GFP was PCR amplified from existing plasmids (gift from M. Pule, UCL). Human PDGFR\u03b1 was amplified from cDNA of the G144 cell line (Pollard et\u00a0al., 2009), PCR products were cloned into Gateway pDONR\u2122221 using BP cloning. The cassettes were then delivered into the intermediate targeting vectors via Gateway LR cloning. Plasmids were sequence verified. EGFRvIII was amplified from existing plasmids (gift from A. Medvinsky lab) incorporating BrsGI restriction sites to clone into a PB-CAG-Ires-Hygro (gift from Keisuke Kaji). Primers used for construction are provided in Table S5.\n        \n        \n          Recombinant Cas9 plasmid and production\n          pET28a/Cas9-Cys was a gift from Hyongbum Kim (Ramakrishna et\u00a0al., 2014). BL21(DE3) cells (New England Biolabs, C2527) were transformed with the plasmid pET28a/Cas9-Cys (Addgene, Cambridge, USA, plasmid #53261) using standard protocols. Cas9 protein expression was induced with 0.5\u00a0mM IPTG (Isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) (Fisher, 10715114) and bacterial cells were incubated overnight at 20\u00b0C. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 20\u00a0mL of lysis buffer (20\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500\u00a0mM NaCl, 1\u00a0mM TCEP, 5\u00a0mM imidazole pH 8.0), sonicated and loaded on a HisTrap HP 5\u00a0mL column (GE, 17-5248-01). Cas9 protein was collected in elution buffer (20\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250\u00a0mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM TCEP, 250\u00a0mM imidazole pH 8.0). Fractions containing Cas9 protein were pooled and loaded into a HiPrep 26/10 Desalting Column (GE, 28-4026-52) to equilibrate in Cas9 buffer (20\u00a0mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 150\u00a0mM KCl, 1\u00a0mM TCEP). Purified Cas9 protein was further concentrated using Vivaspin columns (Vivaspin20, VS2021) as per the user-guide instructions.\n        \n        \n          Cell line derivation\n          Mouse NS cell lines were derived from adult C57BL/6 SCRM subventricular zone as previously described (Conti et\u00a0al., 2005; Sun et\u00a0al., 2008). To obtain tumor cell lines, tumors were dissected from mouse brains and a piece of tumor was transferred into a 35\u00a0cm2 well plate with 2\u00a0mL of accutase. Tissue was minced into small pieces with scalpels and incubated 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C. The accutase with the tissue was transferred into a falcon before adding 6\u00a0mL of serum-free basal medium. Tissue was dissociated with a glass pipette very gently several times. After centrifugation for 5\u00a0min at 500 rcf., the cell pellet was resuspended in complete media and plated in a T25 flask. Cell debris was removed the following day and fresh media was added. Human brain tumor samples were dissociated for cell culture as described by Pollard et\u00a0al. (2009). Briefly, tumor samples were dissociated into single cells using physical dissociation and accutase incubation for 15 \u2013 20\u00a0minutes at 37\u00b0C, followed by the addition of serum-free basal medium and centrifugation for 5\u00a0min at 500 rcf. The cell pellet was resuspended in complete media and plated in a laminin coated flask. Cell debris was removed the following day and fresh media was added.\n        \n        \n          Cell transfection\n          NS cells were transfected using the DN 100 program of a 4D nucleofection system (Lonza). 1.5\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells were resuspended in 100\u00a0\u03bcl of SG transfection solution (Lonza) containing a maximum of 3\u00a0\u03bcg DNA. For CRISPR targeting, ratios of gRNAS and Cas9 were 1:1:2. For transgene overexpression, piggyBac transposase pBase and PB vectors were used in a 1:1 ratio. For multiplex experiments, ratios were equal and the amount of DNA used was 5\u00a0\u03bcg. Media was changed 6 hours after transfection. Cells were incubated for 48 hours post-transfection prior to FACS sorting.\n        \n        \n          Drug selection and clonal expansion\n          Cells with stable integration of the PiggyBac plasmids were selected for 5-7\u00a0days using 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml blasticidin or 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml hygromycin. For individual TSG knockout experiments, GFP positive cells were enriched by FACS single cell sorting into 96-well plates and collected in tubes (bulk population). The Irf8 clonal knockout lines were established using the iotaSciences isoCell system. Clones were expanded after 10-15\u00a0days post single cell disposition and transferred into 2\u00a0\u00d7 96-well replica plates and expanded for cell banking and gDNA extraction. For NPE-Multiplex experiments, GFP and mCherry double positive cells were sorted and collected in tubes. These cells were expanded and maintained for 5\u00a0days with hygromycin and 6\u00a0days with blasticidin and transplanted in mice without picking colonies. After tumor formation, a cell line was derived, NPE-Mx-TD, and individual colonies were picked into 2\u00a0\u00d7 24-well replica plates and expanded for cell banking and gDNA extraction.\n        \n        \n          Genotyping of knockout clones\n          Genomic DNA from individual clones was isolated from 24-well plates using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). 100-150\u00a0ng DNA was used in a 25\u00a0\u03bcL PCR reaction. PCR reactions comprised 0.3\u00a0\u03bcL DMSO (100% v/v, Sigma), 1\u00a0\u03bcL dNTPs (10\u00a0mM, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 5\u00a0\u03bcL LongAMP buffer (5x NEB), 1\u00a0\u03bcL LongAMP Taq (NEB), and 1\u00a0\u03bcL of each primer (at 10\u00a0\u03bcM concentration). Primer sequences are provided in Table S6. Genotyping primers flanking the targeting site of Cas9 were used to identify potential indels and directly assessed by Sanger sequencing traces from the resulting PCR products.\n        \n        \n          Immunocytochemistry\n          Cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 10\u00a0min and then blocked in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 3% Goat Serum. Cells were incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 hour. DNA was stained with a final incubation of cells in 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The specific dilution of primary antibodies used are as follows: mouse Nestin (1:10; DSHB, Rat-401), rabbit Sox2 (1:200; abcam ab2494), mouse GFAP (1:200; Sigma G3893), rabbit Ki-67 (1:200; Thermo Fisher MA5-14520), Tuj1 (1:1000; Biolegend, 801202), mouse p53 (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology 2524).\n        \n        \n          Immunoblotting\n          Immunoblotting was performed using standard protocols. Antibodies were diluted in blocking solution (5% milk powder in TBS-T or 3% BSA/1% PVP in TBS-T). Protein detection was performed using peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) and application of homemade ECL before protein detection by exposure to X-ray films or imaging using the ChemiDock system (BioRad). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit NF1 (1:500; Santa Cruz sc-67), rabbit PTEN (1:1000; CST 9556), rabbit phospho-EGF Receptor Tyr1068 (1:1000; CST 3777), rabbit PDGFRa (1:1000; CST 3174), mouse GAPDH (1:50000; Ambion, AM4300), mouse IRF8 (1:500; eBiosciences 14-7888-82), ACTIN (1:1000; Santa Cruz sc-1616), rabbit pSTAT1 (1:1000, CST 9167).\n        \n        \n          RT-qPCR\n          RT-qPCR was performed using standard protocols. RNA was isolated and gDNA eliminated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, 74104). cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) and RT-qPCR was performed using the QuantStudio 7 Flex (Applied Biosystems) instrument. Each sample/gene combination was run in duplicate or triplicate. TaqMan assays used are provided in Table S7.\n        \n        \n          RPPA analysis\n          Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed as previously described (Teo et\u00a0al., 2018). Briefly, medium was removed from the plates and cells were rinsed twice with PBS. Cells were lysed on ice for 20\u00a0minutes with occasional shaking every 5\u00a0minutes. Cell lysates were collected with a scraper and clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 rcf. for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. Clarified supernatants in biological triplicate were adjusted to 2\u00a0mg/mL concentration and printed onto nitrocellulose-coated slides (Grace Bio-Labs) in a dilution series (four serial 2-fold dilutions) in technical triplicate using an Aushon 2470 arrayer (Aushon Biosystems). Slides were blocked, probed with validated primary antibodies and detected with DyLight 800-conjugated secondary antibodies (New England BioLabs). Slides were read using an InnoScan 710-IR scanner (Innopsys) and quantified using Mapix (Innopsys). Relative fluorescence intensities were normalized to respective FastGreen-stained spots (total protein), and data were computationally analyzed as previously described (Byron, 2017; Teo et\u00a0al., 2018).\n        \n        \n          In\u00a0vivo antibody administration\n          Animals were randomly assigned to test and control groups for all antibody blocking experiments. For CD8\u00a0T Cell Blockade, monoclonal anti-CD8a (Clone YTS 169.4, Cat # BE0117) and anti-IgG2b (Clone LTF-2 Cat # BE0090) antibodies were purchased from 2BScientific (BioXCell) and 20\u00a0\u03bcg of \u0251CD8/IgG2b resuspended in 200\u00a0\u03bcl of PBS was administered via IP injection on alternate days, three times per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) for three weeks, beginning 3\u00a0days post orthotopic transplantation of tumor cells, to ensure continuous CD8+ T\u00a0cell depletion. Anti-mouse CSF1R (CD115) was a kind gift from Sergio Quezada (BioXCell Cat # BP0213). Mice received three doses of 200\u00a0\u03bcg of anti-CSF1R resuspended in 200\u00a0\u03bcl of PBS on alternate days, beginning 5\u00a0days post-orthotopic transplantation of tumor cells.\n        \n        \n          Mouse Brain Fixation, Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry\n          Brains were fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C, then rinsed several times with PBS and stored in PBS\u00a0+0.05% Sodium Azide. For Histopathology procedures, brains were transferred into 70% Ethanol media and then embedded in paraffin for processing. 10\u00a0\u03bcm coronal slices were prepared forhematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. For immunohistochemistry of fixed brain tissue, 20\u00a0\u03bcm vibratome slices were transferred into a 24-well plate. Slices were incubated at room temperature for 30\u00a0min in blocking solution (0.2% Triton X-100 and 3% Goat Serum). Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C as follows: nestin (1:10; DSHB, Rat-401), chicken GFAP (1:100, BioLegend 829401), rabbit Ki-67 (1:100 Thermo Fisher MA5-14520), GFP (1:300 Abcam 13970). After three washes with PBS, slices were incubated with appropriate Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (1:1000, Life technologies) and DAPI (1:2000, Sigma D9542) for 2 hours. Slices were washed three times and were mounted on a slide with FluoroSave\u2122 Reagent (345789, Calbiochem). Slices were examined with a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8).\n        \n        \n          Multiplex Immunofluorescence\n          Staining of deparaffinized 5\u00a0\u03bcm FFPE sections was performed on automated tissue staining system (Bond-Rx, Leica Microsystems, CA) in the SURF facility at the University of Edinburgh. Primary antibodies; GFP (ab13970, Abcam Cambridge, MA, dilution 1:200); F4/80 (MCA497GA, BioRad, Hercules, CA, dilution 1:100); CD45 (NB100-77417SS, Novus, Manchester, UK, dilution, 1:100); Iba1 (ab178846, Abcam, dilution 1:250) were used to detect tumor cells and macrophages. Cells were labeled by using a tyramide signal amplification kit (Opal 7-color automation kit, NEL797001KT, Akoya BioSci. Menlo Park, CA). Opal 520 (1:150 dilution), Opal 570 (1:300, dilution), Opal 620 (1:150, dilution), Opal 650 (1:300 dilution), reactive fluorophores were used. Slides were counter stained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) and mounted by Prolong Diamond Antifade Mountant (P36965, Thermofisher Sci., Waltham, MA). Whole slide brain sections were imaged using the Vectra 3.0 multispectal imaging system (Perkin Elmer) at 20X magnification.\n        \n        \n          Image quantification\n          Images are analyzed in Inform Image analysis software (Version 2.9.4). To spectrally unmix emission spectra of each fluorophore, a spectral library and spectral unmixing algorithm was created using by using autofluorescent and single Opal dye-stained images. Background area were segmented from the tissue and removed from the analysis. The tumor regions was identified by using H&E staining and by staining GFP staining and at least 5 randomly selected ROI regions inside the tumor area was analyzed per tissue (20x object lens). Images were processed for nuclear detection (DAPI+ nuclear objects) and cytoplasm detection (2-pixel wide from nuclear detection). Using built-in machine learning algorithm, cell phenotype in the tumor region was trained by using Iba-1, F4/80 and CD45 markers. At the end of batch processing, the quality of phenotype identification was checked by using processed and component RGB images. Incorrectly classified images and damaged tissues were removed from the analysis. The total number of Iba+ and Iba-1 F4/80+ positive cells per mm2 of tissue and and total cells was calculated from the sum of the total images used per tissue.\n        \n        \n          Preparation of brain cell suspension for flow cytometry\n          For whole brain analysis, brains were dissected from mice and mechanically disaggregated using scissors, followed by enzymatic digestion using liberase (Roche Cat# 05401119001) and DNase (Sigma, Cat: 101041590001). Following enzymatic digestion cells suspension underwent Percoll (GE Healthcare, ref 17-0891-01) gradient separation to obtain cell suspensions enriched on hematopoietic cells. Cell suspensions were incubated 10\u00a0minutes with a blocking mixture of mouse, rat and calf serum containing anti-CD16/32 blocking antibodies (Clone 2.4G2, Bioxcell, Cat: BE0307). Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with a mixture of flow cytometry monoclonal antibodies per 20\u00a0minutes. In order to detect intracellular epitopes cells were fixed and permeabilized using the BD CytoFix/Cytoperm kit (BD, Cat: 554714) following the manufacturer protocol. Cells were resuspended in PBS and acquired using the FACSymphony. Flow cytometry data was compensated and down sampled to 5000 events using FlowJo. Data from down-sampled FCS files was then clustered using Cytofkit and FlowSom restricted to 20 clusters. Clusters were then visualized using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). All data was analyzed using R version 3.6.2. Antibodies for flow cytometry were purchased from Biolegend, BD and ThermoFisher Scientific (eBioscience): CD103-UV395 (Clone M290), CD24-BUV496 (Clone M1/69), Ly6G-BUV563 (Clone IA8), CD11b-BUV661 (Clone M1/70), CD19-BUV737 (Clone 1D3), CD3-BUV737 (Clone 7A2), CD45-BUV805 (Clone HI30), CD68-BV421 (Clone FA-11), GITRL-BV510 (Clone MIH44), Ly6C (Clone AL-21), CD206-BV650 (Clone C068C2), MHCII-BV711 (Clone M5-114-15-2), CD11C-BV786 (Clone N418), CD86-FITC (Clone GL1), 41BBL-BB700 (Clone TKS-1), ICOSL-PE (HK5.3), PDL1-PECF590 (Clone 10F.9G2), OX40L-PeCy7 (Clone RM134L), SIRP\u03b1-APC (Clone P84), F4/80-AF700 (Clone BM8).\n          For analysis of intra-tumoral immune cell populations, GFP\u00a0+ tumors were dissected from brains and placed in 1\u00a0mL RPMI in a 60\u00a0mm cell culture dish and mechanically dissociated using a sterile scalpel. 2\u00a0mL of DMEM supplemented with 2\u00a0mg/ml collagenase D and 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL DNase 1 was added to the tumor sample which was further dissociated by pipetting before transfer to a 50\u00a0mL Falcon tube and incubation at 37\u00b0C, with shaking at 200\u00a0rpm for 30\u00a0min. Following enzymatic digestion, 10\u00a0mL of PBS was added to the tumor cell suspension before centrifugation. All centrifugation steps were carried out at 500 rcf. for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C unless otherwise stated. The supernatant was discarded, and pelleted tumor cells were resuspended in 10\u00a0mL of cold PBS and passed through a cell strainer into a fresh 50\u00a0mL Falcon tube, with a further 5\u00a0mL cold PBS used to encourage as many remaining cells as possible to pass through the strainer. Cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 5\u00a0mL of 1X Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer, incubated at room temperature for 5\u00a0min and pelleted again. The pellet was then resuspended in 10\u00a0mL MACs Buffer (1X HBSS\u00a0+ 2% FBS) and repelleted before decanting MACs Buffer.\n          To remove myelin, cells were resuspended in remaining residual MACs Buffer and 20\u00a0\u03bcl of myelin magnetic beads were added to the cell suspension before a 15\u00a0min incubation at 4\u00b0C. A further 5\u00a0mL of MACs Buffer was added to the cells before centrifugation and resuspension in 1\u00a0mL of MACs Buffer before transfer to a 15\u00a0mL Falcon tube and myelin removal using a MACs machine. Following this, cells were washed with 5\u00a0mL PBS, centrifuged and resuspended in a final volume of 200\u00a0\u03bcl before transfer of each sample to an individual well of a 96-well plate. For controls (unstained/viability only), two 20\u00a0\u03bcl aliquots were removed from each tumor cell sample and placed in independent wells. The plates were sealed (to prevent cross-contamination) and centrifuged. With exception of the sample to be used as an unstained control, cell pellets were resuspended in 100\u00a0\u03bcl of a 1:1000 dilution of Zombie NIR in PBS as a viability stain (unstained sample resuspended in PBS only) and incubated for 20\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. Plates were again sealed and centrifuged followed by two washes of samples in FACS buffer. Pelleted samples were then blocked (50\u00a0\u03bcl of 1:200 CD16/32 in FACS buffer) at 4\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min in the dark. Cells were then stained by adding 50\u00a0\u03bcl of primary antibody mix to the pre-existing Fc block solution and incubated for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C in the dark before pelleting and washing in twice in FACS buffer. Samples being stained for myeloid cell populations were then resuspended in FACS buffer and transferred to FACS tubes for analysis. Samples being stained for T\u00a0cell population markers were permeabilized overnight in fixation/permeabilization buffer at 4\u00b0C and washed twice the following morning in 1X permeabilization buffer before incubation in 100\u00a0\u03bcl of anti-FOXP3 for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C in the dark. Finally, these samples were pelleted, washed twice in FACS buffer and resuspended in FACS buffer and transferred to FACS tubes for analysis. To generate tSNE maps, Flow cytometry data was randomly down sampled to 50,000 events per tumor for three independent tumors and the resulting data concatenated into a single dataset using FlowJo. Data from the resulting fcs file was then clustered using the tSNE plugin in FlowJo with the following settings: Auto(opt-SNE), Iterations: 1000, KNN algorithm: Exact (vantage point tree), gradient algorithm: Flt-SNE. To identify clusters on the tSNE map, concatenated data was subject to conventional gating as detailed in Figure\u00a0S3 and applied to the tSNE map using FlowJo layout editor. All data was analyzed using FlowJo version 10 and R version 4.0.2.\n          Antibodies for flow cytometry were purchased from Biolegend, BD and ThermoFisher Scientific (eBioscience). CD45-AF700 (Clone 30-F11). For the T\u00a0cell Panel: CD3-BV711 (Clone 17A2), CD8-BUV737 (Clone 53-67), CD4-BV510 (Clone GK1.5), TIM3-PE/Dazzle 594 (Clone B8.2C12), CD62L-BUV395 (Clone MEL-14), CD44-BV650 (Clone 1MF), ST2-APC (Clone RMST2-2), \u03b3\u03b4TCR-PerCP/Cy5.5 (CloneGL3), FOXP3-eFlour 450 (CloneFJK.16 s), LAG3-PE-Cyanine7 (Clone eBioC9B7W), PD1-BV605 (Clone 29F.1A12), NK1.1-PE (Clone PK136). For the myeloid cell panel: F4/80-BV421 (Clone BM8), CD11b-BV510 (Clone M1/70), Ly6G-BUV395 (Clone 1A8), CD31-BV605 (Clone 390), PDL1-BV711 (Clone 10F.9G2), Ly6C-PerCP/Cy5.5 (Clone HK1.4), MMR-PE (Clone C068C2), CD11c-PE/Dazzele (Clone N418), CD86-PE/Cy7 (Clone GL-1), PDL2-APC (Clone TY25), CD140a-BV650 (Clone APA5).\n          To isolate immune cells from tumors for co-culture experiments, GFP\u00a0+ tumors were dissected from brains, placed in bijou tube with 1\u00a0mL accutase and mechanically dissociated with a sterile blade, pipetting and disruption with the IKA Ultra TurraxTM Tube Drive followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 30min. Next, 6ml of wash media was added to the tumor cell suspension before centrifugation (all centrifugation steps were carried out at 500 rcf. for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C unless otherwise stated), the supernatant was discarded, and cells were incubated for 10\u00a0minutes at room temperature in RBC lysis buffer (abcam). After centrifugation, the tumor cell suspension was washed once with ice cold PBS\u00a0+ 0.1% BSA and then filtered through a 70\u00a0\u03bcm cell strainer (Falcon). Tumor suspension was resuspended in cold PBS\u00a0+ 0.1% BSA and Fc block was added at a concentration of 1:100 for 5\u00a0minutes at room temperature. The suspension was washed once, before resuspension in 100\u00a0\u03bcL PBS\u00a0+ 0.1% BSA and suitable antibodies for staining and incubated for 30\u00a0minutes, at 4\u00b0C in the dark. Tumor suspension was then washed twice and resuspended in FACS buffer for sorting. Antibodies used were: CD45 (1:200, Biolegend), F4/80 (1:100, eBioscience) and CD3 (1:200, Biolegend).\n        \n        \n          Forward-Phase Protein Arrays (FPPA)\n          Media was conditioned by cells for 48 hours. Antibody microarrays were printed in-house using an Aushon BioSystems\u2019 2470 array printing platform. Microarrays were blocked for 1 hour with SuperG\u2122 Blocking Buffer (Grace Bio Labs) at room temperature on a rocker. Media from samples were centrifuged at 1000 rcf. for 5\u00a0minutes at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were added to microarrays for 12 hours at 4\u00b0C. Microarrays were washed three times for 5\u00a0minutes in TBS-T and blocked for 10\u00a0minutes with SuperG\u2122 Blocking Buffer at room temperature on an orbital shaker, then washed again three times for 5\u00a0minutes in TBS-T. Detection antibodies (1:500 antibody diluted in 5% BSA/PBST, 1% SuperG\u2122 Blocking Buffer) mixtures were made in plates and 2\u00a0\u03bcL of each antibody was applied to each well of the microarrays. Microarrays were clamped and 50\u00a0\u03bcL of each antibody was added to corresponding microarray wells. Microarrays were incubated for 1 hour on a flat surface. Clamps were removed and microarrays were washed three times for 5\u00a0minutes in TBS-T. Microarrays were then blocked for 10\u00a0minutes with SuperG\u2122 Blocking Buffer at room temperature on a rocker and again washed three times for 5\u00a0minutes in PBS-T. 3\u00a0mL of IRDye\u00ae 800CW Streptavidin (LI-COR Biosciences) diluted 1 in 5000 in PBST supplemented with 5% BSA, 1% SuperG\u2122 Blocking Buffer. Microarrays were covered and incubated on a rocker at room temperature for 45\u00a0minutes then washed for 5\u00a0minutes, three times in PBS-T followed by three 5\u00a0min PBS washes and then washed with distilled water. Microarrays were dried then scanned on the InnoScan 710 high resolution Microarray scanner (Innopsys Life Sciences). Data was normalized for protein concentration and background fluorescence in Microsoft Excel. Graphs were calculated using Prism (Graphpad).\n        \n        \n          RNA-seq sample preparation\n          All samples were run in triplicate. RNA was extracted from cells using the QIAGEN RNeasy kit.\n          For mouse samples, sample concentration and quality was assessed using the Aligent Tapestation and Nanodrop, only samples with a RIN value of 9.6 or above were used. Library prep and mRNA sequencing of mouse samples was performed by University of Edinburgh Clinical Research Facility Genetics Core. Further quality control was performed by the facility using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and the Qubit RNA BR assay. Library prep was performed with 500ng of starting material using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation kit. Briefly, poly-A containing mRNA molecules were purified using poly-T oligo attached magnetic beads. These were fragmented, reverse transcribed and further purified to separate blunted dscDNA for adaptor ligation. Library amplification of 12 cycles was used before purification with AMPure XP beads and quantification with the Qubit dsDNA HS assay and QC using the Aligent Bioanalyser. Sequencing was performed using the Illumina NextSeq 500/550 High-Output v2 kit on the NextSeq 550 platform. 48 libraries were pooledin equimolar amounts and run across 3 High-Output Flow Cells.\n          For human samples, RNA samples were run on Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 nano chips to determine RIN values and sample concentrations were measured using Qubit RNA BR assay and 200\u00a0ng of starting material was used. RNaseq libraries were prepared using the KAPA mRNA Hyper prep kit with KAPA SeqCap Adapters. Fragmentation was done at 94C for 6\u00a0minutes and library amplification of 12 cycles. Each library was quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS assay and average fragment size was determined using Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 or DNA HS. Molarity of each library was calculated using the Qubit and BioA results and then normalized to \u223c10\u00a0nM and pooled, 24 libraries per pool. Each pool was then quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS assay and average fragment size determined using Bioanalyzer DNA HS. Pooled library molarity was determined using Qubit and BioA. The libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument. Dilute and denature was done according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions for \u201cDilute and Denature Libraries for cBot Clustering,\u201d Standard normalization method. Each 24-library pool was run on two lanes of a HiSeq High Output flow cell. All human GSCs were processed at passage 3 from derivation.\n        \n        \n          Reduced Representation Bisulphite Sequencing (RRBS) Sample preparation\n          All samples were run in triplicate. DNA was extracted from cells using the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit and sample concentration and quality was assessed using the Nanodrop. Samples were confirmed to have appropriate quality by ensuring 260/280 values were 1.84-1.96 and 260/230 values of 1.93-2.21. RRBS was performed by the University of Edinburgh Clinical Research Facility Genetics Core. 200ng of each sample was processed with the Ovation RRBS Methyl-Seq System 1- 16 (Tecan Genomics Inc, #0353). 0.5ng of unmethylated \u03bbDNA (New England Biolabs, #N3013S) was spiked into each DNA sample to allow assessment of the bisulfite-conversion reaction efficiency. DNA was digested using the methylation-insensitive restriction enzyme, MspI, and fragments were directly ligated to cohesive-ended adapters without the requirement for blunting or A-tailing. Bisulfite-conversion was performed with the Epitect Fast Bisulfite Conversion Kit. Bisulfite- treated adaptor-ligated fragments were then amplified by PCR (9 cycles) before purification using Agencourt RNAClean\u00ae XP beads. RRBS libraries were quantified using the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer and the Qubit dsDNA HS assay and were assessed for size and quality using the Agilent Bioanalyser with the DNA HS Kit. Sequencing was performed using the NextSeq 500/550 High-Output v2.5 Kit on the NextSeq 550 platform. Libraries were combined in three equimolar pools of five and run on three high output flow cells, with \u223c1% PhiX Control library\n        \n        \n          Whole genome sequencing (WGS) sample preparation\n          Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from cells using the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit and submitted to Edinburgh Genomics for processing. Genomic DNA was quantified using Quant-iT Picogreen reagent, Lambda Standard DNA and a Molecular Devices, Spectramax XPS Gemini plate reader. Quality of gDNA was evaluated using an AATI Fragment Analyzer and the Standard Sensitivity Genomic DNA Analysis Kit. Genomic DNA samples > 1000ng and a quality score > 5 pass sample QC. Genomic DNA samples were then pre-normalized to fall within 20-100ng/\u03bcL concentration range required for Illumina SeqLab TruSeq PCR Free library preparation method using the Hamilton MicroLab STAR. Libraries were prepared using Illumina SeqLab specific TruSeq PCR-Free High Throughput library preparation kits in conjunction with the Hamilton MicroLab STAR and Clarity LIMS X Edition according to standard protocols. Genomic DNA was sheared to a 450bp mean insert size using a Covaris LE220 focused-ultrasonicator. Inserts were blunt ended, A-tailed, size selected and had TruSeq adapters ligated onto the ends. Insert size for each library was evaluated using the Caliper GX Touch with a HT DNA 1k/12K/HI SENS LabChip and HT DNA HI SENS Reagent Kit to ensure that mean fragment sizes fell between 300\u00a0bp and 800\u00a0bp. Library concentration was normalized to 1.5nM before being denatured for clustering and sequencing at 300pM using a Hamilton MicroLab STAR with Genologics Clarity LIMS X (4.2) Edition. Libraries were clustered onto a HiSeqX Flow cell v2.5 on cBot2s and the clustered flow cell was transferred to a HiSeqX for sequencing using a HiSeqX Ten Reagent kit v2.5.\n        \n        \n          Bioinformatics Analysis\n          \n            RNA-seq data processing and differential expression\n            RNA sequencing reads were trimmed with TrimGalore (version 0.5.0) and aligned to a reference genome using the pseudo aligner Kallisto with default parameters (version 0.44.0) (Martin, 2011; Bray et\u00a0al., 2016). For mouse and human samples mm10, and hg38 were used respectively. Read counts were summarized via the R package Tximport (version 1.8.0) (Soneson et\u00a0al., 2015) and subsequent normalization was completed via DESeq2 (version 1.27.32) (Love et\u00a0al., 2014). Reported normalized read counts, unless otherwise stated, are as regularised-logarithm transformation (rlog) (Love et\u00a0al., 2014). Differential expression was completed using DESeq2 with log2 fold change shrinkage (Love et\u00a0al., 2014). Genes with less than 1 read count across samples were pre-filtered. Multiple testing was accounted for using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to calculate false discovery rates (FDRs) (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Principal component analysis (PCA) was completed on the top 500 genes with greatest variance across samples. Where heatmaps of normalized expression are clustered this was completed using Ward\u2019s method and Euclidean distance (Murtagh and Legendre, 2014).\n          \n        \n        \n          RNA-seq - Identifying genes specific to tumor derived mutants\n          Genes specific to NPE tumor derived (NPE-BL6-TD and NPE-IE), and NF1 mutant samples (NF1, NP, NPE, NPE-BL6-TD, NPE-NSG-TD, NPE-IE) were identified via the Distal binarization approach as previously described (Corces et\u00a0al., 2018). In brief an intra-group median and inter-quartile range (IQR) were calculated for each gene. For each gene, groups were then ranked by median expression across replicates with BL6 WT samples as a baseline. For any gene where the median expression of a group was higher than 1.5 times the IQR than the group preceding it in rank, this gene was labeled specific to this sample group. All samples ranked higher than this group based on gene expression were also labeled as gene specific. Genes were further filtered such that only specific genes that were also differentially expressed (FDR\u00a0< 0.05, LFC > 1) between relevant comparisons (NPE tumor derived samples\u00a0Vs. All others, and NF1 mutant samples Vs. All others) were retained (Love et\u00a0al., 2014).\n        \n        \n          RNA-seq - Defining human subtypes\n          Genes with low expression (< 10 counts across all groups, with\u00a0< 1 count per sample) and low variability of counts per million reads (CPM) across GSC samples, as calculated by DESeq2, were filtered (SD\u00a0< 5 across groups, and coefficient of variation\u00a0< 0.25). A final 9291 genes were subsequently used for downstream analysis. The NMF package in R (version 0.22.0) was used to perform the brunet implementation of non-negative matrix factorisation using default parameters (Brunet et\u00a0al., 2004; Gaujoux and Seoighe, 2010). The highest cophenetic score was used as a criterion to obtain the optimal number of latent factors (Subtypes: S1 Non-MESImm, S2 MESImm). Two distinct subtypes were consistently obtained when running NMF with different algorithms and returned the most stable consensus clustering when compared with other rank numbers (Lee and Seung, 2001; Brunet et\u00a0al., 2004; Pascual-Montano et\u00a0al., 2006). To extract gene features for each subtype the most specific genes were selected (S1 Non- MESImm: 589, S2 MESImm: 235 genes) with the Kim and Park method as implemented in the NMF package (Kim and Park, 2007). Subtype enrichment scores were derived as the column normalized S1/S2 score (%) for each sample from the NMF coefficient matrix. For downstream analysis subtype labels (S1 Non-MESImm, or S2 MESImm) were applied to each sample as the subtype with the highest enrichment score.\n        \n        \n          RNA-seq - Overrepresentation and gene set enrichment analysis\n          R packages clusterprofiler, (version 3.15.4) and ReactomePA (version 1.31.0) were used to find enriched gene sets for genes specific to tumor derived mouse samples, and human subtypes S1 Non-MESImm, or S2 MESImm (Yu et\u00a0al., 2012; Yu and He, 2016). Where gene ratio is reported this is the number of genes in each pathway or GO term enriched in a gene list of interest (e.g., S1 or S2) divided by the total number of genes in the gene list of interest. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was completed for differentially expressed gene sets via the Broad institute\u2019s GSEA Preranked tool from the GSEA software package 3.0 (Subramanian et\u00a0al., 2005). For human samples the Gene ontology (GO) database for Biological process, Cellular component and Molecular process, was utilized as a gene set database (Harris et\u00a0al., 2004). For mouse samples an equivalent GO database was derived (Lai et\u00a0al., 2016a). Single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), with simplicity scores, was completed using a recent implementation of the ssGSEA algorithm by Wang et\u00a0al., with selected immune GO terms, and glioma subtype gene sets (Mesenchymal, Classical, and Proneural) (Barbie et\u00a0al., 2009; Wang et\u00a0al., 2017).\n        \n        \n          Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing\n          Reads were trimmed with TrimGalore (version 0.5.0). NuGen diversity adaptors were removed with a Python script supplied by NuGen \u201ctrimRRBSdiversityAdaptCustomers.py\u201d (version 1.11 https://github.com/nugentechnologies/NuMetRRBS) (Martin, 2011). Reads were then aligned to the mm10 in silico bisulfite transformed genome with the bisulphite sequencing aligner Bismark (version 0.16.3 with Bowtie version 2.2.6 using parameters: -N 0 -L 20) (Krueger and Andrews, 2011). PCR duplicates were then removed using a Python script from NuGen \u201cnudup.py\u201d (version 2.3 https://github.com/tecangenomics/nudup). Methylation estimation was completed using the Bismark methylation extractor ignoring the first two bases of read 2 to minimize common methylation call bias at these sites. Initial visualization with PCA was completed on the top 25% of CpGs with the highest variance of percentage methylation. No batch effect was observed following PCA. Identification of differentially methylated loci (DMLs) was completed with the R package DSS (version 2.36.0) in multifactor mode to account for RRBS batch (Park and Wu, 2016). FDR was used to account for multiple testing (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were called by merging adjacent statistically significant DMLs within 50bp of one another, and filtering for DMRs with a minimum length of 50bp and with greater than 3 significant CpG sites. CpG island tracks were retrieved from the UCSC table browser service as a BED file (Karolchik et\u00a0al., 2004). Percentage methylation, DMRs, DMLs, and CpG island tracks were visualized using the IGV genome browser (Thorvaldsd\u00f3ttir et\u00a0al., 2013). The annotation of DMRs was completed using the R package ChIPpeakAnno (version 3.22.0) \u2013 where DMRs were attributed to nearest gene promoter/transcription start site (TSS) (Zhu et\u00a0al., 2010). TSS coordinates were defined as \u00b1 2kb of sequence surrounding the start of the first exon. Promoter rank plots were filtered to include DMRs overlapping promoter regions and associated hypomethylated immune genes were highlighted in blue (> 50% methylation loss, overlapping immune and interferon GO terms: GO:0006955, GO:0034341, GO:0034340, GO:0035456, GO:0035455, and GO:0019882). Density heatmaps were produced using the \u2018densityHeatmap\u2019 function from the R package ComplexHeatmap (version 2.4.2), and clustering was completed using Euclidean distance and Ward\u2019s method (Murtagh and Legendre, 2014; Gu, Eils and Schlesner, 2016).\n        \n        \n          Infinium\u00ae MethylationEPIC BeadChip\n          Pre-processing and normalization from idat files to beta values was completed via the R package minfi (version 1.34.0) with combined functional and Noob normalization (Triche et\u00a0al., 2013; Fortin et\u00a0al., 2014, 2017). Poor quality probes, and those that could not be mapped to the hg38 genome, were filtered as previously described (Maksimovic et\u00a0al., 2016; Zhou et\u00a0al., 2017). Classification of human EPIC array samples were completed via the online portal https://www.molecularneuropathology.org/mnp. IDH mutants were removed prior to downstream methylation analysis (Capper et\u00a0al., 2018). DMLs and DMRs were identified via the R Package DMRCate (version 2.2.3) using limma (version 3.43.11) (Peters et\u00a0al., 2015; Ritchie et\u00a0al., 2015). Annotation of DMRs was completed via the R package ChIPpeakAnno by assigning DMRs to nearest TSS (+/\u2212 2kb) (Zhu et\u00a0al., 2010). Density heatmaps were produced using the \u2018densityHeatmap\u2019 function from the R package \u2018ComplexHeatmap\u2019, and clustering was completed using Euclidean distance with Ward\u2019s method (Murtagh and Legendre, 2014; Gu et\u00a0al., 2016).\n        \n        \n          Single-cell RNA-seq\n          Smart-seq2 single cell RNA-seq normalized counts (Transcripts per million, TPM) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) (GEO accession: GSM3828672) for 7930 glioma cells, from 28 separate tumors (Neftel et\u00a0al., 2019). Contaminating cells (Macrophages, T Cells, and Oligodendrocytes) were filtered as previously described (Neftel et\u00a0al., 2019). Paediatric samples were then filtered prior to downstream analysis. PCA was completed on the top 2000 most variable genes. As in the bulk RNA-Seq analysis ssGSEA was completed on each cell for glioma transcriptional subtypes, and immune GO terms. Where subtype labels are applied to individual cells this was completed using ssGSEA - where an S2 MESImm subtype was applied to cells with a MESImm p value\u00a0< 0.05, otherwise a S1 Non-MESImm label was applied. Differential expression between MESImm and Non- MESImm labeled cells was completed using the \u2018findMarkers\u2019 function from the R package scran (version 1.16.0) using default parameters (Lun et\u00a0al., 2016).\n        \n        \n          Whole genome sequencing\n          Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of BL6 WT, NPE and NPE-IE lines was completed using the best practises WGS paired cancer normal pipeline bcbio (bcbio-nextgen version 1.2.3) (https://github.com/bcbio/bcbio-nextgen). Adaptors were trimmed with the read trimmer Atropos (version 1.1.25) (Didion et\u00a0al., 2017), a variant of Cutadapt, and aligned to the mm10 genome using the aligner Bowtie2 (version 2.3.5.1) (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). An additional human EGFRvIII contig was included to capture human reads from the EGFRvIII transgene present in NPE and NPE-IE lines. PCR duplicates were marked with samblaster (version 0.1.25) (Faust and Hall, 2014), and GATK base quality score recalibration was completed on the aligned BAM files (gatk version 3.8) (DePristo et\u00a0al., 2011). Single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling was completed using an ensemble-based approach using VarDict (version 1.6), Strelka2 (version 2.9.10), and Mutect2 (gatk version 3.8) for somatic calling, and freebayes (version 1.1.0.46), GATK HaplotypeCaller (gatk version 3.8), and Strelka2 (version 2.9.10) for germline calling (DePristo et\u00a0al., 2011; Garrison and Marth, 2012; Cibulskis et\u00a0al., 2013; Lai et\u00a0al., 2016b; Kim et\u00a0al., 2018). Germline calls were used to filter final somatic calls. Variants were combined and included in the final call if present in 2 out of 3 variant callers (bcbio min_allele_fraction: 2). Variant calls were targeted at exonic regions as defined by the R package TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.knownGene (version 3.4.4). Structural variants (SVs) were called with Manta (version 1.6.0) (Chen et\u00a0al., 2016). Structural variants that did not pass default Manta filters were removed. Break-end (BND) calls for NPE and NPE-IE samples were either imprecise and without split read evidence or had less than 5 split reads for the alternative allele, and hence were not considered for further analysis. Copy number variants (CNVs) were assessed with CNVkit (version 0.9.6) (Talevich et\u00a0al., 2016). To accommodate parameter flexibility, CNVKit was run outside of bcbio using the \u201cwgs\u201d option, targeted at transcript regions as defined by the R package TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.knownGene. Absolute copy number calls were completed with the \u201cclonal\u201d option to account for known high purity of cell line samples and copy number regions were filtered using confidence interval filtering. SNV and SVs were annotated using the R packages VariantAnnotation (version 1.34.0), TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.knownGene, and BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.masked (version 1.3.99) (Obenchain et\u00a0al., 2014). Following annotation SNV calls were filtered again to remove those within noncoding regions, those that were synonymous, as well as those with an allele frequency (AF)\u00a0< 0.25. Final, filtered, SNV, SV, and CNV calls were overlapped with known cancer driver genes as defined by the COSMIC gene census (https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census), converted to mouse homologs via MGI batch query (http://www.informatics.jax.org/batch) (Sondka et\u00a0al., 2018; Bult et\u00a0al., 2019).\n        \n      \n      \n        Quantification and statistical analysis\n        Statistical analysis was performed on GraphPad or using R (version 4.0.0). Numerical data presented in charts is displayed as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM and analyzed using unpaired t tests unless otherwise stated in corresponding legends of the article. Statistical analysis of survival data was performed on GraphPad using the Log Rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Significance is noted in figures or figure legends; p values are denoted as follows: \u2217\u00a0< 0.05, \u2217\u2217\u00a0< 0.01, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u00a0< 0.001, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u00a0<

Mice were maintained on a regular diet in a pathogen-free facility on a 12-hr light/dark cycle with unlimited access to food and water. Intracranial transplantation of GSCs was performed using a stereotaxic frame to inject 200,000 cells resuspended in 2\u00a0\u03bcl of NSC media into 6- to 8-week-old male NOD/SCID/GAMMA (NSG) or C57BL/6 SCRM (BL6) mouse striatum, following administration of isoflourane general anesthesia and Rimadyl analgesic. Coordinates were 0.6mm anterior and 1.5mm lateral to the Bregma and 2.4\u00a0mm deep. Cell preparation and procedures were done as previously described in Pollard et\u00a0al. (2009). Bioluminescent imaging was performed 20\u00a0minutes after D-Luciferin (50\u00a0mg/kg) subcutaneous injection, using the IVIS Lumina LT Series III instrument (Perkin Elmer). For all antibody blocking experiments, animals were randomly assigned to test and control groups. Blocking antibodies for CD8, CSF1R and IgG2b were administered by intraperitoneal (IP) injection at doses and frequencies described in the method details.\n        \n        \n          Cell culture\n          \n            General cell culture\n            Mouse and human cells were cultured in serum-free basal medium supplemented with N2 and B27 (Life Technologies), laminin (Cultrex, 2\u00a0mg/ml) and growth factors EGF and FGF2 (Peprotech, 10\u00a0ng/ml). Cells were maintained as previously described in Pollard et\u00a0al. (2009).\n          \n        \n        \n          NSC differentiation to astrocytes\n          Cells were seeded 4\u00a0\u00d7 103 cells/ cm2 in NS culture media without EGF or FGF2 and with BMP4 (10\u00a0ng/ml). For neuronal differentiation we seeded cells at 8\u00a0\u00d7 103 cells/cm2 or 4\u00a0\u00d7 103 cells/cm2 for the BL6-NP and BL6-NPE in NS basal media without growth factors. Media was replenished every 3\u20104\u00a0days. Immunostaining for differentiation markers was carried out on day 3 for astrocytes, and day 10 for neurons, post-differentiation initiation.\n        \n        \n          Co-culture of NPE cells with tumor derived immune cells\n          3x104 NPE cells were seeded in NSC culture media in a 12-well plate at least 6 hours prior to introduction of immune cells to allow attachment. F4/80\u00a0+ and CD3+ immune cells were isolated from tumors and collected by flow (detailed below). F4/80\u00a0+ cells were resuspended in \u2018minimal macrophage media\u2019 (DMEM high glucose (GIBCO), 10% FBS (GIBCO), 1% pen/strep (GIBCO)) and CD3 cells were resuspended in \u2018minimal T\u00a0cell media\u2019 (complete RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO) containing 1% pen/strep (GIBCO), 50\u00a0\u03bcM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (GIBCO), and 1% L-glutamine (GIBCO)) before being seeded in a 3.0\u00a0\u03bcm pore polycarbonate membrane transwell insert (SLS, #3402) containing the appropriate medium. Co-culture experiments were carried out overnight (16 \u2013 20 hours).\n        \n        \n          Cell growth analysis\n          NPE and NPE-IE cells were seeded in NSC culture media in a 24-well plate and growth curves were determined using Incucyte (Essen Bioscience) live cell imaging system.\nMice and in\u00a0vivo procedures\n          All treatments and procedures on mice were performed in accordance with protocols approved by Home Office UK guidelines in a designated facility under a project license to S.M.P., (PC0395462) at the University of Edinburgh.

Co-culture experiments were carried out overnight (16 \u2013 20 hours).\nCell growth analysis\n          NPE and NPE-IE cells were seeded in NSC culture media in a 24-well plate and growth curves were determined using Incucyte (Essen Bioscience) live cell imaging system.\nMethod details\n        \n          Design and construction of CRISPR sgRNAs and PiggyBac plasmids\n          For gene knockouts, two gRNAs were designed to remove or generate indels, these were introduced to the most disease relevant gene regions in the case of GBM drivers. CRISPR sgRNAs were designed using the Optimized CRISPR Design tool (https://zlab.bio/guide-design-resources). Sequences are provided in Table S1. For construction of sgRNA-encoding plasmids, single-stranded oligonucleodies (IDT) containing the guide sequence of the sgRNAs were annealed, phosphorylated and ligated into BsaI site of U6-BsaI-sgRNA backbone (kindly provided by S. Gerety, Sanger Institute) or U6-BbsI-CBh-Cas9-T2A-mCherry backbone (this was a gift from Ralf Kuehn, Addgene plasmid # 64324) (Chu et\u00a0al., 2015).\n          PiggyBac expression vectors were constructed via Gateway cloning apart from the EGFRvIII construct. The LUC-2A-GFP was PCR amplified from existing plasmids (gift from M. Pule, UCL). Human PDGFR\u03b1 was amplified from cDNA of the G144 cell line (Pollard et\u00a0al., 2009), PCR products were cloned into Gateway pDONR\u2122221 using BP cloning. The cassettes were then delivered into the intermediate targeting vectors via Gateway LR cloning. Plasmids were sequence verified. EGFRvIII was amplified from existing plasmids (gift from A. Medvinsky lab) incorporating BrsGI restriction sites to clone into a PB-CAG-Ires-Hygro (gift from Keisuke Kaji). Primers used for construction are provided in Table S5.\n        \n        \n          Recombinant Cas9 plasmid and production\n          pET28a/Cas9-Cys was a gift from Hyongbum Kim (Ramakrishna et\u00a0al., 2014). BL21(DE3) cells (New England Biolabs, C2527) were transformed with the plasmid pET28a/Cas9-Cys (Addgene, Cambridge, USA, plasmid #53261) using standard protocols. Cas9 protein expression was induced with 0.5\u00a0mM IPTG (Isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) (Fisher, 10715114) and bacterial cells were incubated overnight at 20\u00b0C. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 20\u00a0mL of lysis buffer (20\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500\u00a0mM NaCl, 1\u00a0mM TCEP, 5\u00a0mM imidazole pH 8.0), sonicated and loaded on a HisTrap HP 5\u00a0mL column (GE, 17-5248-01). Cas9 protein was collected in elution buffer (20\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250\u00a0mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM TCEP, 250\u00a0mM imidazole pH 8.0). Fractions containing Cas9 protein were pooled and loaded into a HiPrep 26/10 Desalting Column (GE, 28-4026-52) to equilibrate in Cas9 buffer (20\u00a0mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 150\u00a0mM KCl, 1\u00a0mM TCEP). Purified Cas9 protein was further concentrated using Vivaspin columns (Vivaspin20, VS2021) as per the user-guide instructions.\n        \n        \n          Cell line derivation\n          Mouse NS cell lines were derived from adult C57BL/6 SCRM subventricular zone as previously described (Conti et\u00a0al., 2005; Sun et\u00a0al., 2008). To obtain tumor cell lines, tumors were dissected from mouse brains and a piece of tumor was transferred into a 35\u00a0cm2 well plate with 2\u00a0mL of accutase. Tissue was minced into small pieces with scalpels and incubated 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C. The accutase with the tissue was transferred into a falcon before adding 6\u00a0mL of serum-free basal medium. Tissue was dissociated with a glass pipette very gently several times. After centrifugation for 5\u00a0min at 500 rcf., the cell pellet was resuspended in complete media and plated in a T25 flask. Cell debris was removed the following day and fresh media was added. Human brain tumor samples were dissociated for cell culture as described by Pollard et\u00a0al. (2009). Briefly, tumor samples were dissociated into single cells using physical dissociation and accutase incubation for 15 \u2013 20\u00a0minutes at 37\u00b0C, followed by the addition of serum-free basal medium and centrifugation for 5\u00a0min at 500 rcf. The cell pellet was resuspended in complete media and plated in a laminin coated flask. Cell debris was removed the following day and fresh media was added.\n        \n        \n          Cell transfection\n          NS cells were transfected using the DN 100 program of a 4D nucleofection system (Lonza). 1.5\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells were resuspended in 100\u00a0\u03bcl of SG transfection solution (Lonza) containing a maximum of 3\u00a0\u03bcg DNA. For CRISPR targeting, ratios of gRNAS and Cas9 were 1:1:2. For transgene overexpression, piggyBac transposase pBase and PB vectors were used in a 1:1 ratio. For multiplex experiments, ratios were equal and the amount of DNA used was 5\u00a0\u03bcg. Media was changed 6 hours after transfection. Cells were incubated for 48 hours post-transfection prior to FACS sorting.\n        \n        \n          Drug selection and clonal expansion\n          Cells with stable integration of the PiggyBac plasmids were selected for 5-7\u00a0days using 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml blasticidin or 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml hygromycin. For individual TSG knockout experiments, GFP positive cells were enriched by FACS single cell sorting into 96-well plates and collected in tubes (bulk population). The Irf8 clonal knockout lines were established using the iotaSciences isoCell system. Clones were expanded after 10-15\u00a0days post single cell disposition and transferred into 2\u00a0\u00d7 96-well replica plates and expanded for cell banking and gDNA extraction. For NPE-Multiplex experiments, GFP and mCherry double positive cells were sorted and collected in tubes. These cells were expanded and maintained for 5\u00a0days with hygromycin and 6\u00a0days with blasticidin and transplanted in mice without picking colonies. After tumor formation, a cell line was derived, NPE-Mx-TD, and individual colonies were picked into 2\u00a0\u00d7 24-well replica plates and expanded for cell banking and gDNA extraction.\n        \n        \n          Genotyping of knockout clones\n          Genomic DNA from individual clones was isolated from 24-well plates using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). 100-150\u00a0ng DNA was used in a 25\u00a0\u03bcL PCR reaction. PCR reactions comprised 0.3\u00a0\u03bcL DMSO (100% v/v, Sigma), 1\u00a0\u03bcL dNTPs (10\u00a0mM, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 5\u00a0\u03bcL LongAMP buffer (5x NEB), 1\u00a0\u03bcL LongAMP Taq (NEB), and 1\u00a0\u03bcL of each primer (at 10\u00a0\u03bcM concentration). Primer sequences are provided in Table S6. Genotyping primers flanking the targeting site of Cas9 were used to identify potential indels and directly assessed by Sanger sequencing traces from the resulting PCR products.\n        \n        \n          Immunocytochemistry\n          Cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 10\u00a0min and then blocked in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 3% Goat Serum. Cells were incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 hour. DNA was stained with a final incubation of cells in 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The specific dilution of primary antibodies used are as follows: mouse Nestin (1:10; DSHB, Rat-401), rabbit Sox2 (1:200; abcam ab2494), mouse GFAP (1:200; Sigma G3893), rabbit Ki-67 (1:200; Thermo Fisher MA5-14520), Tuj1 (1:1000; Biolegend, 801202), mouse p53 (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology 2524).\n        \n        \n          Immunoblotting\n          Immunoblotting was performed using standard protocols. Antibodies were diluted in blocking solution (5% milk powder in TBS-T or 3% BSA/1% PVP in TBS-T). Protein detection was performed using peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) and application of homemade ECL before protein detection by exposure to X-ray films or imaging using the ChemiDock system (BioRad). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit NF1 (1:500; Santa Cruz sc-67), rabbit PTEN (1:1000; CST 9556), rabbit phospho-EGF Receptor Tyr1068 (1:1000; CST 3777), rabbit PDGFRa (1:1000; CST 3174), mouse GAPDH (1:50000; Ambion, AM4300), mouse IRF8 (1:500; eBiosciences 14-7888-82), ACTIN (1:1000; Santa Cruz sc-1616), rabbit pSTAT1 (1:1000, CST 9167).\n        \n        \n          RT-qPCR\n          RT-qPCR was performed using standard protocols. RNA was isolated and gDNA eliminated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, 74104). cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) and RT-qPCR was performed using the QuantStudio 7 Flex (Applied Biosystems) instrument. Each sample/gene combination was run in duplicate or triplicate. TaqMan assays used are provided in Table S7.\n        \n        \n          RPPA analysis\n          Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed as previously described (Teo et\u00a0al., 2018). Briefly, medium was removed from the plates and cells were rinsed twice with PBS. Cells were lysed on ice for 20\u00a0minutes with occasional shaking every 5\u00a0minutes. Cell lysates were collected with a scraper and clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 rcf. for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. Clarified supernatants in biological triplicate were adjusted to 2\u00a0mg/mL concentration and printed onto nitrocellulose-coated slides (Grace Bio-Labs) in a dilution series (four serial 2-fold dilutions) in technical triplicate using an Aushon 2470 arrayer (Aushon Biosystems). Slides were blocked, probed with validated primary antibodies and detected with DyLight 800-conjugated secondary antibodies (New England BioLabs). Slides were read using an InnoScan 710-IR scanner (Innopsys) and quantified using Mapix (Innopsys). Relative fluorescence intensities were normalized to respective FastGreen-stained spots (total protein), and data were computationally analyzed as previously described (Byron, 2017; Teo et\u00a0al., 2018).\n        \n        \n          In\u00a0vivo antibody administration\n          Animals were randomly assigned to test and control groups for all antibody blocking experiments. For CD8\u00a0T Cell Blockade, monoclonal anti-CD8a (Clone YTS 169.4, Cat # BE0117) and anti-IgG2b (Clone LTF-2 Cat # BE0090) antibodies were purchased from 2BScientific (BioXCell) and 20\u00a0\u03bcg of \u0251CD8/IgG2b resuspended in 200\u00a0\u03bcl of PBS was administered via IP injection on alternate days, three times per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) for three weeks, beginning 3\u00a0days post orthotopic transplantation of tumor cells, to ensure continuous CD8+ T\u00a0cell depletion. Anti-mouse CSF1R (CD115) was a kind gift from Sergio Quezada (BioXCell Cat # BP0213). Mice received three doses of 200\u00a0\u03bcg of anti-CSF1R resuspended in 200\u00a0\u03bcl of PBS on alternate days, beginning 5\u00a0days post-orthotopic transplantation of tumor cells.\n        \n        \n          Mouse Brain Fixation, Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry\n          Brains were fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C, then rinsed several times with PBS and stored in PBS\u00a0+0.05% Sodium Azide. For Histopathology procedures, brains were transferred into 70% Ethanol media and then embedded in paraffin for processing. 10\u00a0\u03bcm coronal slices were prepared forhematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. For immunohistochemistry of fixed brain tissue, 20\u00a0\u03bcm vibratome slices were transferred into a 24-well plate. Slices were incubated at room temperature for 30\u00a0min in blocking solution (0.2% Triton X-100 and 3% Goat Serum). Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C as follows: nestin (1:10; DSHB, Rat-401), chicken GFAP (1:100, BioLegend 829401), rabbit Ki-67 (1:100 Thermo Fisher MA5-14520), GFP (1:300 Abcam 13970). After three washes with PBS, slices were incubated with appropriate Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (1:1000, Life technologies) and DAPI (1:2000, Sigma D9542) for 2 hours. Slices were washed three times and were mounted on a slide with FluoroSave\u2122 Reagent (345789, Calbiochem). Slices were examined with a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8).\n        \n        \n          Multiplex Immunofluorescence\n          Staining of deparaffinized 5\u00a0\u03bcm FFPE sections was performed on automated tissue staining system (Bond-Rx, Leica Microsystems, CA) in the SURF facility at the University of Edinburgh. Primary antibodies; GFP (ab13970, Abcam Cambridge, MA, dilution 1:200); F4/80 (MCA497GA, BioRad, Hercules, CA, dilution 1:100); CD45 (NB100-77417SS, Novus, Manchester, UK, dilution, 1:100); Iba1 (ab178846, Abcam, dilution 1:250) were used to detect tumor cells and macrophages. Cells were labeled by using a tyramide signal amplification kit (Opal 7-color automation kit, NEL797001KT, Akoya BioSci. Menlo Park, CA). Opal 520 (1:150 dilution), Opal 570 (1:300, dilution), Opal 620 (1:150, dilution), Opal 650 (1:300 dilution), reactive fluorophores were used. Slides were counter stained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) and mounted by Prolong Diamond Antifade Mountant (P36965, Thermofisher Sci., Waltham, MA). Whole slide brain sections were imaged using the Vectra 3.0 multispectal imaging system (Perkin Elmer) at 20X magnification.\n        \n        \n          Image quantification\n          Images are analyzed in Inform Image analysis software (Version 2.9.4). To spectrally unmix emission spectra of each fluorophore, a spectral library and spectral unmixing algorithm was created using by using autofluorescent and single Opal dye-stained images. Background area were segmented from the tissue and removed from the analysis. The tumor regions was identified by using H&E staining and by staining GFP staining and at least 5 randomly selected ROI regions inside the tumor area was analyzed per tissue (20x object lens). Images were processed for nuclear detection (DAPI+ nuclear objects) and cytoplasm detection (2-pixel wide from nuclear detection). Using built-in machine learning algorithm, cell phenotype in the tumor region was trained by using Iba-1, F4/80 and CD45 markers. At the end of batch processing, the quality of phenotype identification was checked by using processed and component RGB images. Incorrectly classified images and damaged tissues were removed from the analysis. The total number of Iba+ and Iba-1 F4/80+ positive cells per mm2 of tissue and and total cells was calculated from the sum of the total images used per tissue.\n        \n        \n          Preparation of brain cell suspension for flow cytometry\n          For whole brain analysis, brains were dissected from mice and mechanically disaggregated using scissors, followed by enzymatic digestion using liberase (Roche Cat# 05401119001) and DNase (Sigma, Cat: 101041590001). Following enzymatic digestion cells suspension underwent Percoll (GE Healthcare, ref 17-0891-01) gradient separation to obtain cell suspensions enriched on hematopoietic cells. Cell suspensions were incubated 10\u00a0minutes with a blocking mixture of mouse, rat and calf serum containing anti-CD16/32 blocking antibodies (Clone 2.4G2, Bioxcell, Cat: BE0307). Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with a mixture of flow cytometry monoclonal antibodies per 20\u00a0minutes. In order to detect intracellular epitopes cells were fixed and permeabilized using the BD CytoFix/Cytoperm kit (BD, Cat: 554714) following the manufacturer protocol. Cells were resuspended in PBS and acquired using the FACSymphony. Flow cytometry data was compensated and down sampled to 5000 events using FlowJo. Data from down-sampled FCS files was then clustered using Cytofkit and FlowSom restricted to 20 clusters. Clusters were then visualized using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). All data was analyzed using R version 3.6.2. Antibodies for flow cytometry were purchased from Biolegend, BD and ThermoFisher Scientific (eBioscience): CD103-UV395 (Clone M290), CD24-BUV496 (Clone M1/69), Ly6G-BUV563 (Clone IA8), CD11b-BUV661 (Clone M1/70), CD19-BUV737 (Clone 1D3), CD3-BUV737 (Clone 7A2), CD45-BUV805 (Clone HI30), CD68-BV421 (Clone FA-11), GITRL-BV510 (Clone MIH44), Ly6C (Clone AL-21), CD206-BV650 (Clone C068C2), MHCII-BV711 (Clone M5-114-15-2), CD11C-BV786 (Clone N418), CD86-FITC (Clone GL1), 41BBL-BB700 (Clone TKS-1), ICOSL-PE (HK5.3), PDL1-PECF590 (Clone 10F.9G2), OX40L-PeCy7 (Clone RM134L), SIRP\u03b1-APC (Clone P84), F4/80-AF700 (Clone BM8).\n          For analysis of intra-tumoral immune cell populations, GFP\u00a0+ tumors were dissected from brains and placed in 1\u00a0mL RPMI in a 60\u00a0mm cell culture dish and mechanically dissociated using a sterile scalpel. 2\u00a0mL of DMEM supplemented with 2\u00a0mg/ml collagenase D and 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL DNase 1 was added to the tumor sample which was further dissociated by pipetting before transfer to a 50\u00a0mL Falcon tube and incubation at 37\u00b0C, with shaking at 200\u00a0rpm for 30\u00a0min. Following enzymatic digestion, 10\u00a0mL of PBS was added to the tumor cell suspension before centrifugation. All centrifugation steps were carried out at 500 rcf. for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C unless otherwise stated. The supernatant was discarded, and pelleted tumor cells were resuspended in 10\u00a0mL of cold PBS and passed through a cell strainer into a fresh 50\u00a0mL Falcon tube, with a further 5\u00a0mL cold PBS used to encourage as many remaining cells as possible to pass through the strainer. Cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 5\u00a0mL of 1X Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer, incubated at room temperature for 5\u00a0min and pelleted again. The pellet was then resuspended in 10\u00a0mL MACs Buffer (1X HBSS\u00a0+ 2% FBS) and repelleted before decanting MACs Buffer.\n          To remove myelin, cells were resuspended in remaining residual MACs Buffer and 20\u00a0\u03bcl of myelin magnetic beads were added to the cell suspension before a 15\u00a0min incubation at 4\u00b0C. A further 5\u00a0mL of MACs Buffer was added to the cells before centrifugation and resuspension in 1\u00a0mL of MACs Buffer before transfer to a 15\u00a0mL Falcon tube and myelin removal using a MACs machine. Following this, cells were washed with 5\u00a0mL PBS, centrifuged and resuspended in a final volume of 200\u00a0\u03bcl before transfer of each sample to an individual well of a 96-well plate. For controls (unstained/viability only), two 20\u00a0\u03bcl aliquots were removed from each tumor cell sample and placed in independent wells. The plates were sealed (to prevent cross-contamination) and centrifuged. With exception of the sample to be used as an unstained control, cell pellets were resuspended in 100\u00a0\u03bcl of a 1:1000 dilution of Zombie NIR in PBS as a viability stain (unstained sample resuspended in PBS only) and incubated for 20\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. Plates were again sealed and centrifuged followed by two washes of samples in FACS buffer. Pelleted samples were then blocked (50\u00a0\u03bcl of 1:200 CD16/32 in FACS buffer) at 4\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min in the dark. Cells were then stained by adding 50\u00a0\u03bcl of primary antibody mix to the pre-existing Fc block solution and incubated for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C in the dark before pelleting and washing in twice in FACS buffer. Samples being stained for myeloid cell populations were then resuspended in FACS buffer and transferred to FACS tubes for analysis. Samples being stained for T\u00a0cell population markers were permeabilized overnight in fixation/permeabilization buffer at 4\u00b0C and washed twice the following morning in 1X permeabilization buffer before incubation in 100\u00a0\u03bcl of anti-FOXP3 for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C in the dark. Finally, these samples were pelleted, washed twice in FACS buffer and resuspended in FACS buffer and transferred to FACS tubes for analysis. To generate tSNE maps, Flow cytometry data was randomly down sampled to 50,000 events per tumor for three independent tumors and the resulting data concatenated into a single dataset using FlowJo. Data from the resulting fcs file was then clustered using the tSNE plugin in FlowJo with the following settings: Auto(opt-SNE), Iterations: 1000, KNN algorithm: Exact (vantage point tree), gradient algorithm: Flt-SNE. To identify clusters on the tSNE map, concatenated data was subject to conventional gating as detailed in Figure\u00a0S3 and applied to the tSNE map using FlowJo layout editor. All data was analyzed using FlowJo version 10 and R version 4.0.2.\n          Antibodies for flow cytometry were purchased from Biolegend, BD and ThermoFisher Scientific (eBioscience).

Next, 6ml of wash media was added to the tumor cell suspension before centrifugation (all centrifugation steps were carried out at 500 rcf. for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C unless otherwise stated), the supernatant was discarded, and cells were incubated for 10\u00a0minutes at room temperature in RBC lysis buffer (abcam). After centrifugation, the tumor cell suspension was washed once with ice cold PBS\u00a0+ 0.1% BSA and then filtered through a 70\u00a0\u03bcm cell strainer (Falcon). Tumor suspension was resuspended in cold PBS\u00a0+ 0.1% BSA and Fc block was added at a concentration of 1:100 for 5\u00a0minutes at room temperature. The suspension was washed once, before resuspension in 100\u00a0\u03bcL PBS\u00a0+ 0.1% BSA and suitable antibodies for staining and incubated for 30\u00a0minutes, at 4\u00b0C in the dark. Tumor suspension was then washed twice and resuspended in FACS buffer for sorting. Antibodies used were: CD45 (1:200, Biolegend), F4/80 (1:100, eBioscience) and CD3 (1:200, Biolegend).\n        \n        \n          Forward-Phase Protein Arrays (FPPA)\n          Media was conditioned by cells for 48 hours. Antibody microarrays were printed in-house using an Aushon BioSystems\u2019 2470 array printing platform. Microarrays were blocked for 1 hour with SuperG\u2122 Blocking Buffer (Grace Bio Labs) at room temperature on a rocker. Media from samples were centrifuged at 1000 rcf. for 5\u00a0minutes at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were added to microarrays for 12 hours at 4\u00b0C. Microarrays were washed three times for 5\u00a0minutes in TBS-T and blocked for 10\u00a0minutes with SuperG\u2122 Blocking Buffer at room temperature on an orbital shaker, then washed again three times for 5\u00a0minutes in TBS-T. Detection antibodies (1:500 antibody diluted in 5% BSA/PBST, 1% SuperG\u2122 Blocking Buffer) mixtures were made in plates and 2\u00a0\u03bcL of each antibody was applied to each well of the microarrays. Microarrays were clamped and 50\u00a0\u03bcL of each antibody was added to corresponding microarray wells. Microarrays were incubated for 1 hour on a flat surface. Clamps were removed and microarrays were washed three times for 5\u00a0minutes in TBS-T. Microarrays were then blocked for 10\u00a0minutes with SuperG\u2122 Blocking Buffer at room temperature on a rocker and again washed three times for 5\u00a0minutes in PBS-T. 3\u00a0mL of IRDye\u00ae 800CW Streptavidin (LI-COR Biosciences) diluted 1 in 5000 in PBST supplemented with 5% BSA, 1% SuperG\u2122 Blocking Buffer. Microarrays were covered and incubated on a rocker at room temperature for 45\u00a0minutes then washed for 5\u00a0minutes, three times in PBS-T followed by three 5\u00a0min PBS washes and then washed with distilled water. Microarrays were dried then scanned on the InnoScan 710 high resolution Microarray scanner (Innopsys Life Sciences). Data was normalized for protein concentration and background fluorescence in Microsoft Excel. Graphs were calculated using Prism (Graphpad).\n        \n        \n          RNA-seq sample preparation\n          All samples were run in triplicate. RNA was extracted from cells using the QIAGEN RNeasy kit.\n          For mouse samples, sample concentration and quality was assessed using the Aligent Tapestation and Nanodrop, only samples with a RIN value of 9.6 or above were used. Library prep and mRNA sequencing of mouse samples was performed by University of Edinburgh Clinical Research Facility Genetics Core. Further quality control was performed by the facility using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and the Qubit RNA BR assay. Library prep was performed with 500ng of starting material using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation kit. Briefly, poly-A containing mRNA molecules were purified using poly-T oligo attached magnetic beads. These were fragmented, reverse transcribed and further purified to separate blunted dscDNA for adaptor ligation. Library amplification of 12 cycles was used before purification with AMPure XP beads and quantification with the Qubit dsDNA HS assay and QC using the Aligent Bioanalyser. Sequencing was performed using the Illumina NextSeq 500/550 High-Output v2 kit on the NextSeq 550 platform. 48 libraries were pooledin equimolar amounts and run across 3 High-Output Flow Cells.\n          For human samples, RNA samples were run on Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 nano chips to determine RIN values and sample concentrations were measured using Qubit RNA BR assay and 200\u00a0ng of starting material was used. RNaseq libraries were prepared using the KAPA mRNA Hyper prep kit with KAPA SeqCap Adapters. Fragmentation was done at 94C for 6\u00a0minutes and library amplification of 12 cycles. Each library was quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS assay and average fragment size was determined using Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 or DNA HS. Molarity of each library was calculated using the Qubit and BioA results and then normalized to \u223c10\u00a0nM and pooled, 24 libraries per pool. Each pool was then quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS assay and average fragment size determined using Bioanalyzer DNA HS. Pooled library molarity was determined using Qubit and BioA. The libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument. Dilute and denature was done according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions for \u201cDilute and Denature Libraries for cBot Clustering,\u201d Standard normalization method. Each 24-library pool was run on two lanes of a HiSeq High Output flow cell. All human GSCs were processed at passage 3 from derivation.\n        \n        \n          Reduced Representation Bisulphite Sequencing (RRBS) Sample preparation\n          All samples were run in triplicate. DNA was extracted from cells using the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit and sample concentration and quality was assessed using the Nanodrop. Samples were confirmed to have appropriate quality by ensuring 260/280 values were 1.84-1.96 and 260/230 values of 1.93-2.21. RRBS was performed by the University of Edinburgh Clinical Research Facility Genetics Core. 200ng of each sample was processed with the Ovation RRBS Methyl-Seq System 1- 16 (Tecan Genomics Inc, #0353). 0.5ng of unmethylated \u03bbDNA (New England Biolabs, #N3013S) was spiked into each DNA sample to allow assessment of the bisulfite-conversion reaction efficiency. DNA was digested using the methylation-insensitive restriction enzyme, MspI, and fragments were directly ligated to cohesive-ended adapters without the requirement for blunting or A-tailing. Bisulfite-conversion was performed with the Epitect Fast Bisulfite Conversion Kit. Bisulfite- treated adaptor-ligated fragments were then amplified by PCR (9 cycles) before purification using Agencourt RNAClean\u00ae XP beads. RRBS libraries were quantified using the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer and the Qubit dsDNA HS assay and were assessed for size and quality using the Agilent Bioanalyser with the DNA HS Kit. Sequencing was performed using the NextSeq 500/550 High-Output v2.5 Kit on the NextSeq 550 platform. Libraries were combined in three equimolar pools of five and run on three high output flow cells, with \u223c1% PhiX Control library\n        \n        \n          Whole genome sequencing (WGS) sample preparation\n          Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from cells using the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit and submitted to Edinburgh Genomics for processing. Genomic DNA was quantified using Quant-iT Picogreen reagent, Lambda Standard DNA and a Molecular Devices, Spectramax XPS Gemini plate reader. Quality of gDNA was evaluated using an AATI Fragment Analyzer and the Standard Sensitivity Genomic DNA Analysis Kit. Genomic DNA samples > 1000ng and a quality score > 5 pass sample QC. Genomic DNA samples were then pre-normalized to fall within 20-100ng/\u03bcL concentration range required for Illumina SeqLab TruSeq PCR Free library preparation method using the Hamilton MicroLab STAR. Libraries were prepared using Illumina SeqLab specific TruSeq PCR-Free High Throughput library preparation kits in conjunction with the Hamilton MicroLab STAR and Clarity LIMS X Edition according to standard protocols. Genomic DNA was sheared to a 450bp mean insert size using a Covaris LE220 focused-ultrasonicator. Inserts were blunt ended, A-tailed, size selected and had TruSeq adapters ligated onto the ends. Insert size for each library was evaluated using the Caliper GX Touch with a HT DNA 1k/12K/HI SENS LabChip and HT DNA HI SENS Reagent Kit to ensure that mean fragment sizes fell between 300\u00a0bp and 800\u00a0bp. Library concentration was normalized to 1.5nM before being denatured for clustering and sequencing at 300pM using a Hamilton MicroLab STAR with Genologics Clarity LIMS X (4.2) Edition. Libraries were clustered onto a HiSeqX Flow cell v2.5 on cBot2s and the clustered flow cell was transferred to a HiSeqX for sequencing using a HiSeqX Ten Reagent kit v2.5.\n        \n        \n          Bioinformatics Analysis\n          \n            RNA-seq data processing and differential expression\n            RNA sequencing reads were trimmed with TrimGalore (version 0.5.0) and aligned to a reference genome using the pseudo aligner Kallisto with default parameters (version 0.44.0) (Martin, 2011; Bray et\u00a0al., 2016). For mouse and human samples mm10, and hg38 were used respectively. Read counts were summarized via the R package Tximport (version 1.8.0) (Soneson et\u00a0al., 2015) and subsequent normalization was completed via DESeq2 (version 1.27.32) (Love et\u00a0al., 2014). Reported normalized read counts, unless otherwise stated, are as regularised-logarithm transformation (rlog) (Love et\u00a0al., 2014). Differential expression was completed using DESeq2 with log2 fold change shrinkage (Love et\u00a0al., 2014). Genes with less than 1 read count across samples were pre-filtered. Multiple testing was accounted for using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to calculate false discovery rates (FDRs) (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Principal component analysis (PCA) was completed on the top 500 genes with greatest variance across samples. Where heatmaps of normalized expression are clustered this was completed using Ward\u2019s method and Euclidean distance (Murtagh and Legendre, 2014).\n          \n        \n        \n          RNA-seq - Identifying genes specific to tumor derived mutants\n          Genes specific to NPE tumor derived (NPE-BL6-TD and NPE-IE), and NF1 mutant samples (NF1, NP, NPE, NPE-BL6-TD, NPE-NSG-TD, NPE-IE) were identified via the Distal binarization approach as previously described (Corces et\u00a0al., 2018). In brief an intra-group median and inter-quartile range (IQR) were calculated for each gene. For each gene, groups were then ranked by median expression across replicates with BL6 WT samples as a baseline. For any gene where the median expression of a group was higher than 1.5 times the IQR than the group preceding it in rank, this gene was labeled specific to this sample group. All samples ranked higher than this group based on gene expression were also labeled as gene specific. Genes were further filtered such that only specific genes that were also differentially expressed (FDR\u00a0< 0.05, LFC > 1) between relevant comparisons (NPE tumor derived samples\u00a0Vs. All others, and NF1 mutant samples Vs. All others) were retained (Love et\u00a0al., 2014).\n        \n        \n          RNA-seq - Defining human subtypes\n          Genes with low expression (< 10 counts across all groups, with\u00a0< 1 count per sample) and low variability of counts per million reads (CPM) across GSC samples, as calculated by DESeq2, were filtered (SD\u00a0< 5 across groups, and coefficient of variation\u00a0< 0.25). A final 9291 genes were subsequently used for downstream analysis. The NMF package in R (version 0.22.0) was used to perform the brunet implementation of non-negative matrix factorisation using default parameters (Brunet et\u00a0al., 2004; Gaujoux and Seoighe, 2010). The highest cophenetic score was used as a criterion to obtain the optimal number of latent factors (Subtypes: S1 Non-MESImm, S2 MESImm). Two distinct subtypes were consistently obtained when running NMF with different algorithms and returned the most stable consensus clustering when compared with other rank numbers (Lee and Seung, 2001; Brunet et\u00a0al., 2004; Pascual-Montano et\u00a0al., 2006). To extract gene features for each subtype the most specific genes were selected (S1 Non- MESImm: 589, S2 MESImm: 235 genes) with the Kim and Park method as implemented in the NMF package (Kim and Park, 2007). Subtype enrichment scores were derived as the column normalized S1/S2 score (%) for each sample from the NMF coefficient matrix. For downstream analysis subtype labels (S1 Non-MESImm, or S2 MESImm) were applied to each sample as the subtype with the highest enrichment score.\n        \n        \n          RNA-seq - Overrepresentation and gene set enrichment analysis\n          R packages clusterprofiler, (version 3.15.4) and ReactomePA (version 1.31.0) were used to find enriched gene sets for genes specific to tumor derived mouse samples, and human subtypes S1 Non-MESImm, or S2 MESImm (Yu et\u00a0al., 2012; Yu and He, 2016). Where gene ratio is reported this is the number of genes in each pathway or GO term enriched in a gene list of interest (e.g., S1 or S2) divided by the total number of genes in the gene list of interest. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was completed for differentially expressed gene sets via the Broad institute\u2019s GSEA Preranked tool from the GSEA software package 3.0 (Subramanian et\u00a0al., 2005). For human samples the Gene ontology (GO) database for Biological process, Cellular component and Molecular process, was utilized as a gene set database (Harris et\u00a0al., 2004). For mouse samples an equivalent GO database was derived (Lai et\u00a0al., 2016a). Single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), with simplicity scores, was completed using a recent implementation of the ssGSEA algorithm by Wang et\u00a0al., with selected immune GO terms, and glioma subtype gene sets (Mesenchymal, Classical, and Proneural) (Barbie et\u00a0al., 2009; Wang et\u00a0al., 2017).\n        \n        \n          Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing\n          Reads were trimmed with TrimGalore (version 0.5.0). NuGen diversity adaptors were removed with a Python script supplied by NuGen \u201ctrimRRBSdiversityAdaptCustomers.py\u201d (version 1.11 https://github.com/nugentechnologies/NuMetRRBS) (Martin, 2011). Reads were then aligned to the mm10 in silico bisulfite transformed genome with the bisulphite sequencing aligner Bismark (version 0.16.3 with Bowtie version 2.2.6 using parameters: -N 0 -L 20) (Krueger and Andrews, 2011). PCR duplicates were then removed using a Python script from NuGen \u201cnudup.py\u201d (version 2.3 https://github.com/tecangenomics/nudup). Methylation estimation was completed using the Bismark methylation extractor ignoring the first two bases of read 2 to minimize common methylation call bias at these sites. Initial visualization with PCA was completed on the top 25% of CpGs with the highest variance of percentage methylation. No batch effect was observed following PCA. Identification of differentially methylated loci (DMLs) was completed with the R package DSS (version 2.36.0) in multifactor mode to account for RRBS batch (Park and Wu, 2016). FDR was used to account for multiple testing (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were called by merging adjacent statistically significant DMLs within 50bp of one another, and filtering for DMRs with a minimum length of 50bp and with greater than 3 significant CpG sites. CpG island tracks were retrieved from the UCSC table browser service as a BED file (Karolchik et\u00a0al., 2004). Percentage methylation, DMRs, DMLs, and CpG island tracks were visualized using the IGV genome browser (Thorvaldsd\u00f3ttir et\u00a0al., 2013). The annotation of DMRs was completed using the R package ChIPpeakAnno (version 3.22.0) \u2013 where DMRs were attributed to nearest gene promoter/transcription start site (TSS) (Zhu et\u00a0al., 2010). TSS coordinates were defined as \u00b1 2kb of sequence surrounding the start of the first exon. Promoter rank plots were filtered to include DMRs overlapping promoter regions and associated hypomethylated immune genes were highlighted in blue (> 50% methylation loss, overlapping immune and interferon GO terms: GO:0006955, GO:0034341, GO:0034340, GO:0035456, GO:0035455, and GO:0019882). Density heatmaps were produced using the \u2018densityHeatmap\u2019 function from the R package ComplexHeatmap (version 2.4.2), and clustering was completed using Euclidean distance and Ward\u2019s method (Murtagh and Legendre, 2014; Gu, Eils and Schlesner, 2016).\n        \n        \n          Infinium\u00ae MethylationEPIC BeadChip\n          Pre-processing and normalization from idat files to beta values was completed via the R package minfi (version 1.34.0) with combined functional and Noob normalization (Triche et\u00a0al., 2013; Fortin et\u00a0al., 2014, 2017). Poor quality probes, and those that could not be mapped to the hg38 genome, were filtered as previously described (Maksimovic et\u00a0al., 2016; Zhou et\u00a0al., 2017). Classification of human EPIC array samples were completed via the online portal https://www.molecularneuropathology.org/mnp. IDH mutants were removed prior to downstream methylation analysis (Capper et\u00a0al., 2018). DMLs and DMRs were identified via the R Package DMRCate (version 2.2.3) using limma (version 3.43.11) (Peters et\u00a0al., 2015; Ritchie et\u00a0al., 2015). Annotation of DMRs was completed via the R package ChIPpeakAnno by assigning DMRs to nearest TSS (+/\u2212 2kb) (Zhu et\u00a0al., 2010). Density heatmaps were produced using the \u2018densityHeatmap\u2019 function from the R package \u2018ComplexHeatmap\u2019, and clustering was completed using Euclidean distance with Ward\u2019s method (Murtagh and Legendre, 2014; Gu et\u00a0al., 2016).\n        \n        \n          Single-cell RNA-seq\n          Smart-seq2 single cell RNA-seq normalized counts (Transcripts per million, TPM) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) (GEO accession: GSM3828672) for 7930 glioma cells, from 28 separate tumors (Neftel et\u00a0al., 2019). Contaminating cells (Macrophages, T Cells, and Oligodendrocytes) were filtered as previously described (Neftel et\u00a0al., 2019). Paediatric samples were then filtered prior to downstream analysis. PCA was completed on the top 2000 most variable genes. As in the bulk RNA-Seq analysis ssGSEA was completed on each cell for glioma transcriptional subtypes, and immune GO terms. Where subtype labels are applied to individual cells this was completed using ssGSEA - where an S2 MESImm subtype was applied to cells with a MESImm p value\u00a0< 0.05, otherwise a S1 Non-MESImm label was applied. Differential expression between MESImm and Non- MESImm labeled cells was completed using the \u2018findMarkers\u2019 function from the R package scran (version 1.16.0) using default parameters (Lun et\u00a0al., 2016).\n        \n        \n          Whole genome sequencing\n          Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of BL6 WT, NPE and NPE-IE lines was completed using the best practises WGS paired cancer normal pipeline bcbio (bcbio-nextgen version 1.2.3) (https://github.com/bcbio/bcbio-nextgen). Adaptors were trimmed with the read trimmer Atropos (version 1.1.25) (Didion et\u00a0al., 2017), a variant of Cutadapt, and aligned to the mm10 genome using the aligner Bowtie2 (version 2.3.5.1) (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). An additional human EGFRvIII contig was included to capture human reads from the EGFRvIII transgene present in NPE and NPE-IE lines. PCR duplicates were marked with samblaster (version 0.1.25) (Faust and Hall, 2014), and GATK base quality score recalibration was completed on the aligned BAM files (gatk version 3.8) (DePristo et\u00a0al., 2011). Single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling was completed using an ensemble-based approach using VarDict (version 1.6), Strelka2 (version 2.9.10), and Mutect2 (gatk version 3.8) for somatic calling, and freebayes (version 1.1.0.46), GATK HaplotypeCaller (gatk version 3.8), and Strelka2 (version 2.9.10) for germline calling (DePristo et\u00a0al., 2011; Garrison and Marth, 2012; Cibulskis et\u00a0al., 2013; Lai et\u00a0al., 2016b; Kim et\u00a0al., 2018). Germline calls were used to filter final somatic calls. Variants were combined and included in the final call if present in 2 out of 3 variant callers (bcbio min_allele_fraction: 2). Variant calls were targeted at exonic regions as defined by the R package TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.knownGene (version 3.4.4). Structural variants (SVs) were called with Manta (version 1.6.0) (Chen et\u00a0al., 2016). Structural variants that did not pass default Manta filters were removed. Break-end (BND) calls for NPE and NPE-IE samples were either imprecise and without split read evidence or had less than 5 split reads for the alternative allele, and hence were not considered for further analysis. Copy number variants (CNVs) were assessed with CNVkit (version 0.9.6) (Talevich et\u00a0al., 2016). To accommodate parameter flexibility, CNVKit was run outside of bcbio using the \u201cwgs\u201d option, targeted at transcript regions as defined by the R package TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.knownGene. Absolute copy number calls were completed with the \u201cclonal\u201d option to account for known high purity of cell line samples and copy number regions were filtered using confidence interval filtering. SNV and SVs were annotated using the R packages VariantAnnotation (version 1.34.0), TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.knownGene, and BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.masked (version 1.3.99) (Obenchain et\u00a0al., 2014). Following annotation SNV calls were filtered again to remove those within noncoding regions, those that were synonymous, as well as those with an allele frequency (AF)\u00a0< 0.25. Final, filtered, SNV, SV, and CNV calls were overlapped with known cancer driver genes as defined by the COSMIC gene census (https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census), converted to mouse homologs via MGI batch query (http://www.informatics.jax.org/batch) (Sondka et\u00a0al., 2018; Bult et\u00a0al., 2019).\nDesign and construction of CRISPR sgRNAs and PiggyBac plasmids\n          For gene knockouts, two gRNAs were designed to remove or generate indels, these were introduced to the most disease relevant gene regions in the case of GBM drivers. CRISPR sgRNAs were designed using the Optimized CRISPR Design tool (https://zlab.bio/guide-design-resources). Sequences are provided in Table S1. For construction of sgRNA-encoding plasmids, single-stranded oligonucleodies (IDT) containing the guide sequence of the sgRNAs were annealed, phosphorylated and ligated into BsaI site of U6-BsaI-sgRNA backbone (kindly provided by S. Gerety, Sanger Institute) or U6-BbsI-CBh-Cas9-T2A-mCherry backbone (this was a gift from Ralf Kuehn, Addgene plasmid # 64324) (Chu et\u00a0al., 2015).\n          PiggyBac expression vectors were constructed via Gateway cloning apart from the EGFRvIII construct. The LUC-2A-GFP was PCR amplified from existing plasmids (gift from M. Pule, UCL). Human PDGFR\u03b1 was amplified from cDNA of the G144 cell line (Pollard et\u00a0al., 2009), PCR products were cloned into Gateway pDONR\u2122221 using BP cloning. The cassettes were then delivered into the intermediate targeting vectors via Gateway LR cloning. Plasmids were sequence verified. EGFRvIII was amplified from existing plasmids (gift from A. Medvinsky lab) incorporating BrsGI restriction sites to clone into a PB-CAG-Ires-Hygro (gift from Keisuke Kaji). Primers used for construction are provided in Table S5.\nRecombinant Cas9 plasmid and production\n          pET28a/Cas9-Cys was a gift from Hyongbum Kim (Ramakrishna et\u00a0al., 2014). BL21(DE3) cells (New England Biolabs, C2527) were transformed with the plasmid pET28a/Cas9-Cys (Addgene, Cambridge, USA, plasmid #53261) using standard protocols. Cas9 protein expression was induced with 0.5\u00a0mM IPTG (Isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) (Fisher, 10715114) and bacterial cells were incubated overnight at 20\u00b0C. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 20\u00a0mL of lysis buffer (20\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500\u00a0mM NaCl, 1\u00a0mM TCEP, 5\u00a0mM imidazole pH 8.0), sonicated and loaded on a HisTrap HP 5\u00a0mL column (GE, 17-5248-01). Cas9 protein was collected in elution buffer (20\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250\u00a0mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM TCEP, 250\u00a0mM imidazole pH 8.0). Fractions containing Cas9 protein were pooled and loaded into a HiPrep 26/10 Desalting Column (GE, 28-4026-52) to equilibrate in Cas9 buffer (20\u00a0mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 150\u00a0mM KCl, 1\u00a0mM TCEP). Purified Cas9 protein was further concentrated using Vivaspin columns (Vivaspin20, VS2021) as per the user-guide instructions.\nCell line derivation\n          Mouse NS cell lines were derived from adult C57BL/6 SCRM subventricular zone as previously described (Conti et\u00a0al., 2005; Sun et\u00a0al., 2008). To obtain tumor cell lines, tumors were dissected from mouse brains and a piece of tumor was transferred into a 35\u00a0cm2 well plate with 2\u00a0mL of accutase. Tissue was minced into small pieces with scalpels and incubated 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C. The accutase with the tissue was transferred into a falcon before adding 6\u00a0mL of serum-free basal medium. Tissue was dissociated with a glass pipette very gently several times. After centrifugation for 5\u00a0min at 500 rcf., the cell pellet was resuspended in complete media and plated in a T25 flask. Cell debris was removed the following day and fresh media was added. Human brain tumor samples were dissociated for cell culture as described by Pollard et\u00a0al. (2009). Briefly, tumor samples were dissociated into single cells using physical dissociation and accutase incubation for 15 \u2013 20\u00a0minutes at 37\u00b0C, followed by the addition of serum-free basal medium and centrifugation for 5\u00a0min at 500 rcf. The cell pellet was resuspended in complete media and plated in a laminin coated flask. Cell debris was removed the following day and fresh media was added.\nCell transfection\n          NS cells were transfected using the DN 100 program of a 4D nucleofection system (Lonza). 1.5\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells were resuspended in 100\u00a0\u03bcl of SG transfection solution (Lonza) containing a maximum of 3\u00a0\u03bcg DNA. For CRISPR targeting, ratios of gRNAS and Cas9 were 1:1:2. For transgene overexpression, piggyBac transposase pBase and PB vectors were used in a 1:1 ratio. For multiplex experiments, ratios were equal and the amount of DNA used was 5\u00a0\u03bcg. Media was changed 6 hours after transfection. Cells were incubated for 48 hours post-transfection prior to FACS sorting.\nDrug selection and clonal expansion\n          Cells with stable integration of the PiggyBac plasmids were selected for 5-7\u00a0days using 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml blasticidin or 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml hygromycin. For individual TSG knockout experiments, GFP positive cells were enriched by FACS single cell sorting into 96-well plates and collected in tubes (bulk population). The Irf8 clonal knockout lines were established using the iotaSciences isoCell system. Clones were expanded after 10-15\u00a0days post single cell disposition and transferred into 2\u00a0\u00d7 96-well replica plates and expanded for cell banking and gDNA extraction. For NPE-Multiplex experiments, GFP and mCherry double positive cells were sorted and collected in tubes. These cells were expanded and maintained for 5\u00a0days with hygromycin and 6\u00a0days with blasticidin and transplanted in mice without picking colonies. After tumor formation, a cell line was derived, NPE-Mx-TD, and individual colonies were picked into 2\u00a0\u00d7 24-well replica plates and expanded for cell banking and gDNA extraction.\nGenotyping of knockout clones\n          Genomic DNA from individual clones was isolated from 24-well plates using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). 100-150\u00a0ng DNA was used in a 25\u00a0\u03bcL PCR reaction. PCR reactions comprised 0.3\u00a0\u03bcL DMSO (100% v/v, Sigma), 1\u00a0\u03bcL dNTPs (10\u00a0mM, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 5\u00a0\u03bcL LongAMP buffer (5x NEB), 1\u00a0\u03bcL LongAMP Taq (NEB), and 1\u00a0\u03bcL of each primer (at 10\u00a0\u03bcM concentration). Primer sequences are provided in Table S6. Genotyping primers flanking the targeting site of Cas9 were used to identify potential indels and directly assessed by Sanger sequencing traces from the resulting PCR products.\nImmunocytochemistry\n          Cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 10\u00a0min and then blocked in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 3% Goat Serum. Cells were incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 hour. DNA was stained with a final incubation of cells in 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The specific dilution of primary antibodies used are as follows: mouse Nestin (1:10; DSHB, Rat-401), rabbit Sox2 (1:200; abcam ab2494), mouse GFAP (1:200; Sigma G3893), rabbit Ki-67 (1:200; Thermo Fisher MA5-14520), Tuj1 (1:1000; Biolegend, 801202), mouse p53 (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology 2524).\nImmunoblotting\n          Immunoblotting was performed using standard protocols. Antibodies were diluted in blocking solution (5% milk powder in TBS-T or 3% BSA/1% PVP in TBS-T). Protein detection was performed using peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) and application of homemade ECL before protein detection by exposure to X-ray films or imaging using the ChemiDock system (BioRad). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit NF1 (1:500; Santa Cruz sc-67), rabbit PTEN (1:1000; CST 9556), rabbit phospho-EGF Receptor Tyr1068 (1:1000; CST 3777), rabbit PDGFRa (1:1000; CST 3174), mouse GAPDH (1:50000; Ambion, AM4300), mouse IRF8 (1:500; eBiosciences 14-7888-82), ACTIN (1:1000; Santa Cruz sc-1616), rabbit pSTAT1 (1:1000, CST 9167).\nRT-qPCR\n          RT-qPCR was performed using standard protocols. RNA was isolated and gDNA eliminated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, 74104). cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) and RT-qPCR was performed using the QuantStudio 7 Flex (Applied Biosystems) instrument. Each sample/gene combination was run in duplicate or triplicate. TaqMan assays used are provided in Table S7.\nRPPA analysis\n          Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed as previously described (Teo et\u00a0al., 2018). Briefly, medium was removed from the plates and cells were rinsed twice with PBS. Cells were lysed on ice for 20\u00a0minutes with occasional shaking every 5\u00a0minutes. Cell lysates were collected with a scraper and clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 rcf. for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. Clarified supernatants in biological triplicate were adjusted to 2\u00a0mg/mL concentration and printed onto nitrocellulose-coated slides (Grace Bio-Labs) in a dilution series (four serial 2-fold dilutions) in technical triplicate using an Aushon 2470 arrayer (Aushon Biosystems). Slides were blocked, probed with validated primary antibodies and detected with DyLight 800-conjugated secondary antibodies (New England BioLabs). Slides were read using an InnoScan 710-IR scanner (Innopsys) and quantified using Mapix (Innopsys). Relative fluorescence intensities were normalized to respective FastGreen-stained spots (total protein), and data were computationally analyzed as previously described (Byron, 2017; Teo et\u00a0al., 2018).\nMouse Brain Fixation, Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry\n          Brains were fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C, then rinsed several times with PBS and stored in PBS\u00a0+0.05% Sodium Azide. For Histopathology procedures, brains were transferred into 70% Ethanol media and then embedded in paraffin for processing. 10\u00a0\u03bcm coronal slices were prepared forhematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. For immunohistochemistry of fixed brain tissue, 20\u00a0\u03bcm vibratome slices were transferred into a 24-well plate. Slices were incubated at room temperature for 30\u00a0min in blocking solution (0.2% Triton X-100 and 3% Goat Serum). Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C as follows: nestin (1:10; DSHB, Rat-401), chicken GFAP (1:100, BioLegend 829401), rabbit Ki-67 (1:100 Thermo Fisher MA5-14520), GFP (1:300 Abcam 13970). After three washes with PBS, slices were incubated with appropriate Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (1:1000, Life technologies) and DAPI (1:2000, Sigma D9542) for 2 hours. Slices were washed three times and were mounted on a slide with FluoroSave\u2122 Reagent (345789, Calbiochem). Slices were examined with a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8).\nMultiplex Immunofluorescence\n          Staining of deparaffinized 5\u00a0\u03bcm FFPE sections was performed on automated tissue staining system (Bond-Rx, Leica Microsystems, CA) in the SURF facility at the University of Edinburgh. Primary antibodies; GFP (ab13970, Abcam Cambridge, MA, dilution 1:200); F4/80 (MCA497GA, BioRad, Hercules, CA, dilution 1:100); CD45 (NB100-77417SS, Novus, Manchester, UK, dilution, 1:100); Iba1 (ab178846, Abcam, dilution 1:250) were used to detect tumor cells and macrophages. Cells were labeled by using a tyramide signal amplification kit (Opal 7-color automation kit, NEL797001KT, Akoya BioSci. Menlo Park, CA). Opal 520 (1:150 dilution), Opal 570 (1:300, dilution), Opal 620 (1:150, dilution), Opal 650 (1:300 dilution), reactive fluorophores were used. Slides were counter stained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) and mounted by Prolong Diamond Antifade Mountant (P36965, Thermofisher Sci., Waltham, MA). Whole slide brain sections were imaged using the Vectra 3.0 multispectal imaging system (Perkin Elmer) at 20X magnification.\nImage quantification\n          Images are analyzed in Inform Image analysis software (Version 2.9.4). To spectrally unmix emission spectra of each fluorophore, a spectral library and spectral unmixing algorithm was created using by using autofluorescent and single Opal dye-stained images. Background area were segmented from the tissue and removed from the analysis. The tumor regions was identified by using H&E staining and by staining GFP staining and at least 5 randomly selected ROI regions inside the tumor area was analyzed per tissue (20x object lens). Images were processed for nuclear detection (DAPI+ nuclear objects) and cytoplasm detection (2-pixel wide from nuclear detection). Using built-in machine learning algorithm, cell phenotype in the tumor region was trained by using Iba-1, F4/80 and CD45 markers. At the end of batch processing, the quality of phenotype identification was checked by using processed and component RGB images. Incorrectly classified images and damaged tissues were removed from the analysis. The total number of Iba+ and Iba-1 F4/80+ positive cells per mm2 of tissue and and total cells was calculated from the sum of the total images used per tissue.\nPreparation of brain cell suspension for flow cytometry\n          For whole brain analysis, brains were dissected from mice and mechanically disaggregated using scissors, followed by enzymatic digestion using liberase (Roche Cat# 05401119001) and DNase (Sigma, Cat: 101041590001). Following enzymatic digestion cells suspension underwent Percoll (GE Healthcare, ref 17-0891-01) gradient separation to obtain cell suspensions enriched on hematopoietic cells. Cell suspensions were incubated 10\u00a0minutes with a blocking mixture of mouse, rat and calf serum containing anti-CD16/32 blocking antibodies (Clone 2.4G2, Bioxcell, Cat: BE0307). Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with a mixture of flow cytometry monoclonal antibodies per 20\u00a0minutes. In order to detect intracellular epitopes cells were fixed and permeabilized using the BD CytoFix/Cytoperm kit (BD, Cat: 554714) following the manufacturer protocol. Cells were resuspended in PBS and acquired using the FACSymphony. Flow cytometry data was compensated and down sampled to 5000 events using FlowJo. Data from down-sampled FCS files was then clustered using Cytofkit and FlowSom restricted to 20 clusters. Clusters were then visualized using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). All data was analyzed using R version 3.6.2. Antibodies for flow cytometry were purchased from Biolegend, BD and ThermoFisher Scientific (eBioscience): CD103-UV395 (Clone M290), CD24-BUV496 (Clone M1/69), Ly6G-BUV563 (Clone IA8), CD11b-BUV661 (Clone M1/70), CD19-BUV737 (Clone 1D3), CD3-BUV737 (Clone 7A2), CD45-BUV805 (Clone HI30), CD68-BV421 (Clone FA-11), GITRL-BV510 (Clone MIH44), Ly6C (Clone AL-21), CD206-BV650 (Clone C068C2), MHCII-BV711 (Clone M5-114-15-2), CD11C-BV786 (Clone N418), CD86-FITC (Clone GL1), 41BBL-BB700 (Clone TKS-1), ICOSL-PE (HK5.3), PDL1-PECF590 (Clone 10F.9G2), OX40L-PeCy7 (Clone RM134L), SIRP\u03b1-APC (Clone P84), F4/80-AF700 (Clone BM8).\n          For analysis of intra-tumoral immune cell populations, GFP\u00a0+ tumors were dissected from brains and placed in 1\u00a0mL RPMI in a 60\u00a0mm cell culture dish and mechanically dissociated using a sterile scalpel. 2\u00a0mL of DMEM supplemented with 2\u00a0mg/ml collagenase D and 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL DNase 1 was added to the tumor sample which was further dissociated by pipetting before transfer to a 50\u00a0mL Falcon tube and incubation at 37\u00b0C, with shaking at 200\u00a0rpm for 30\u00a0min. Following enzymatic digestion, 10\u00a0mL of PBS was added to the tumor cell suspension before centrifugation. All centrifugation steps were carried out at 500 rcf. for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C unless otherwise stated. The supernatant was discarded, and pelleted tumor cells were resuspended in 10\u00a0mL of cold PBS and passed through a cell strainer into a fresh 50\u00a0mL Falcon tube, with a further 5\u00a0mL cold PBS used to encourage as many remaining cells as possible to pass through the strainer. Cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 5\u00a0mL of 1X Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer, incubated at room temperature for 5\u00a0min and pelleted again. The pellet was then resuspended in 10\u00a0mL MACs Buffer (1X HBSS\u00a0+ 2% FBS) and repelleted before decanting MACs Buffer.\n          To remove myelin, cells were resuspended in remaining residual MACs Buffer and 20\u00a0\u03bcl of myelin magnetic beads were added to the cell suspension before a 15\u00a0min incubation at 4\u00b0C. A further 5\u00a0mL of MACs Buffer was added to the cells before centrifugation and resuspension in 1\u00a0mL of MACs Buffer before transfer to a 15\u00a0mL Falcon tube and myelin removal using a MACs machine. Following this, cells were washed with 5\u00a0mL PBS, centrifuged and resuspended in a final volume of 200\u00a0\u03bcl before transfer of each sample to an individual well of a 96-well plate. For controls (unstained/viability only), two 20\u00a0\u03bcl aliquots were removed from each tumor cell sample and placed in independent wells. The plates were sealed (to prevent cross-contamination) and centrifuged. With exception of the sample to be used as an unstained control, cell pellets were resuspended in 100\u00a0\u03bcl of a 1:1000 dilution of Zombie NIR in PBS as a viability stain (unstained sample resuspended in PBS only) and incubated for 20\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. Plates were again sealed and centrifuged followed by two washes of samples in FACS buffer. Pelleted samples were then blocked (50\u00a0\u03bcl of 1:200 CD16/32 in FACS buffer) at 4\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min in the dark. Cells were then stained by adding 50\u00a0\u03bcl of primary antibody mix to the pre-existing Fc block solution and incubated for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C in the dark before pelleting and washing in twice in FACS buffer. Samples being stained for myeloid cell populations were then resuspended in FACS buffer and transferred to FACS tubes for analysis. Samples being stained for T\u00a0cell population markers were permeabilized overnight in fixation/permeabilization buffer at 4\u00b0C and washed twice the following morning in 1X permeabilization buffer before incubation in 100\u00a0\u03bcl of anti-FOXP3 for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C in the dark. Finally, these samples were pelleted, washed twice in FACS buffer and resuspended in FACS buffer and transferred to FACS tubes for analysis. To generate tSNE maps, Flow cytometry data was randomly down sampled to 50,000 events per tumor for three independent tumors and the resulting data concatenated into a single dataset using FlowJo. Data from the resulting fcs file was then clustered using the tSNE plugin in FlowJo with the following settings: Auto(opt-SNE), Iterations: 1000, KNN algorithm: Exact (vantage point tree), gradient algorithm: Flt-SNE. To identify clusters on the tSNE map, concatenated data was subject to conventional gating as detailed in Figure\u00a0S3 and applied to the tSNE map using FlowJo layout editor. All data was analyzed using FlowJo version 10 and R version 4.0.2.\n          Antibodies for flow cytometry were purchased from Biolegend, BD and ThermoFisher Scientific (eBioscience).

Next, 6ml of wash media was added to the tumor cell suspension before centrifugation (all centrifugation steps were carried out at 500 rcf. for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C unless otherwise stated), the supernatant was discarded, and cells were incubated for 10\u00a0minutes at room temperature in RBC lysis buffer (abcam). After centrifugation, the tumor cell suspension was washed once with ice cold PBS\u00a0+ 0.1% BSA and then filtered through a 70\u00a0\u03bcm cell strainer (Falcon). Tumor suspension was resuspended in cold PBS\u00a0+ 0.1% BSA and Fc block was added at a concentration of 1:100 for 5\u00a0minutes at room temperature. The suspension was washed once, before resuspension in 100\u00a0\u03bcL PBS\u00a0+ 0.1% BSA and suitable antibodies for staining and incubated for 30\u00a0minutes, at 4\u00b0C in the dark. Tumor suspension was then washed twice and resuspended in FACS buffer for sorting. Antibodies used were: CD45 (1:200, Biolegend), F4/80 (1:100, eBioscience) and CD3 (1:200, Biolegend).\nForward-Phase Protein Arrays (FPPA)\n          Media was conditioned by cells for 48 hours. Antibody microarrays were printed in-house using an Aushon BioSystems\u2019 2470 array printing platform. Microarrays were blocked for 1 hour with SuperG\u2122 Blocking Buffer (Grace Bio Labs) at room temperature on a rocker. Media from samples were centrifuged at 1000 rcf. for 5\u00a0minutes at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were added to microarrays for 12 hours at 4\u00b0C. Microarrays were washed three times for 5\u00a0minutes in TBS-T and blocked for 10\u00a0minutes with SuperG\u2122 Blocking Buffer at room temperature on an orbital shaker, then washed again three times for 5\u00a0minutes in TBS-T. Detection antibodies (1:500 antibody diluted in 5% BSA/PBST, 1% SuperG\u2122 Blocking Buffer) mixtures were made in plates and 2\u00a0\u03bcL of each antibody was applied to each well of the microarrays. Microarrays were clamped and 50\u00a0\u03bcL of each antibody was added to corresponding microarray wells. Microarrays were incubated for 1 hour on a flat surface. Clamps were removed and microarrays were washed three times for 5\u00a0minutes in TBS-T. Microarrays were then blocked for 10\u00a0minutes with SuperG\u2122 Blocking Buffer at room temperature on a rocker and again washed three times for 5\u00a0minutes in PBS-T. 3\u00a0mL of IRDye\u00ae 800CW Streptavidin (LI-COR Biosciences) diluted 1 in 5000 in PBST supplemented with 5% BSA, 1% SuperG\u2122 Blocking Buffer.

Microarrays were dried then scanned on the InnoScan 710 high resolution Microarray scanner (Innopsys Life Sciences). Data was normalized for protein concentration and background fluorescence in Microsoft Excel. Graphs were calculated using Prism (Graphpad).\nRNA-seq sample preparation\n          All samples were run in triplicate. RNA was extracted from cells using the QIAGEN RNeasy kit.\n          For mouse samples, sample concentration and quality was assessed using the Aligent Tapestation and Nanodrop, only samples with a RIN value of 9.6 or above were used. Library prep and mRNA sequencing of mouse samples was performed by University of Edinburgh Clinical Research Facility Genetics Core. Further quality control was performed by the facility using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and the Qubit RNA BR assay. Library prep was performed with 500ng of starting material using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation kit. Briefly, poly-A containing mRNA molecules were purified using poly-T oligo attached magnetic beads. These were fragmented, reverse transcribed and further purified to separate blunted dscDNA for adaptor ligation. Library amplification of 12 cycles was used before purification with AMPure XP beads and quantification with the Qubit dsDNA HS assay and QC using the Aligent Bioanalyser. Sequencing was performed using the Illumina NextSeq 500/550 High-Output v2 kit on the NextSeq 550 platform. 48 libraries were pooledin equimolar amounts and run across 3 High-Output Flow Cells.\n          For human samples, RNA samples were run on Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 nano chips to determine RIN values and sample concentrations were measured using Qubit RNA BR assay and 200\u00a0ng of starting material was used. RNaseq libraries were prepared using the KAPA mRNA Hyper prep kit with KAPA SeqCap Adapters. Fragmentation was done at 94C for 6\u00a0minutes and library amplification of 12 cycles. Each library was quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS assay and average fragment size was determined using Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 or DNA HS. Molarity of each library was calculated using the Qubit and BioA results and then normalized to \u223c10\u00a0nM and pooled, 24 libraries per pool. Each pool was then quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS assay and average fragment size determined using Bioanalyzer DNA HS. Pooled library molarity was determined using Qubit and BioA. The libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument. Dilute and denature was done according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions for \u201cDilute and Denature Libraries for cBot Clustering,\u201d Standard normalization method. Each 24-library pool was run on two lanes of a HiSeq High Output flow cell. All human GSCs were processed at passage 3 from derivation.\nReduced Representation Bisulphite Sequencing (RRBS) Sample preparation\n          All samples were run in triplicate. DNA was extracted from cells using the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit and sample concentration and quality was assessed using the Nanodrop. Samples were confirmed to have appropriate quality by ensuring 260/280 values were 1.84-1.96 and 260/230 values of 1.93-2.21. RRBS was performed by the University of Edinburgh Clinical Research Facility Genetics Core. 200ng of each sample was processed with the Ovation RRBS Methyl-Seq System 1- 16 (Tecan Genomics Inc, #0353). 0.5ng of unmethylated \u03bbDNA (New England Biolabs, #N3013S) was spiked into each DNA sample to allow assessment of the bisulfite-conversion reaction efficiency. DNA was digested using the methylation-insensitive restriction enzyme, MspI, and fragments were directly ligated to cohesive-ended adapters without the requirement for blunting or A-tailing. Bisulfite-conversion was performed with the Epitect Fast Bisulfite Conversion Kit. Bisulfite- treated adaptor-ligated fragments were then amplified by PCR (9 cycles) before purification using Agencourt RNAClean\u00ae XP beads. RRBS libraries were quantified using the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer and the Qubit dsDNA HS assay and were assessed for size and quality using the Agilent Bioanalyser with the DNA HS Kit. Sequencing was performed using the NextSeq 500/550 High-Output v2.5 Kit on the NextSeq 550 platform. Libraries were combined in three equimolar pools of five and run on three high output flow cells, with \u223c1% PhiX Control library\nWhole genome sequencing (WGS) sample preparation\n          Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from cells using the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit and submitted to Edinburgh Genomics for processing. Genomic DNA was quantified using Quant-iT Picogreen reagent, Lambda Standard DNA and a Molecular Devices, Spectramax XPS Gemini plate reader. Quality of gDNA was evaluated using an AATI Fragment Analyzer and the Standard Sensitivity Genomic DNA Analysis Kit. Genomic DNA samples > 1000ng and a quality score > 5 pass sample QC. Genomic DNA samples were then pre-normalized to fall within 20-100ng/\u03bcL concentration range required for Illumina SeqLab TruSeq PCR Free library preparation method using the Hamilton MicroLab STAR. Libraries were prepared using Illumina SeqLab specific TruSeq PCR-Free High Throughput library preparation kits in conjunction with the Hamilton MicroLab STAR and Clarity LIMS X Edition according to standard protocols. Genomic DNA was sheared to a 450bp mean insert size using a Covaris LE220 focused-ultrasonicator. Inserts were blunt ended, A-tailed, size selected and had TruSeq adapters ligated onto the ends. Insert size for each library was evaluated using the Caliper GX Touch with a HT DNA 1k/12K/HI SENS LabChip and HT DNA HI SENS Reagent Kit to ensure that mean fragment sizes fell between 300\u00a0bp and 800\u00a0bp. Library concentration was normalized to 1.5nM before being denatured for clustering and sequencing at 300pM using a Hamilton MicroLab STAR with Genologics Clarity LIMS X (4.2) Edition. Libraries were clustered onto a HiSeqX Flow cell v2.5 on cBot2s and the clustered flow cell was transferred to a HiSeqX for sequencing using a HiSeqX Ten Reagent kit v2.5.\nBioinformatics Analysis\n          \n            RNA-seq data processing and differential expression\n            RNA sequencing reads were trimmed with TrimGalore (version 0.5.0) and aligned to a reference genome using the pseudo aligner Kallisto with default parameters (version 0.44.0) (Martin, 2011; Bray et\u00a0al., 2016). For mouse and human samples mm10, and hg38 were used respectively. Read counts were summarized via the R package Tximport (version 1.8.0) (Soneson et\u00a0al., 2015) and subsequent normalization was completed via DESeq2 (version 1.27.32) (Love et\u00a0al., 2014). Reported normalized read counts, unless otherwise stated, are as regularised-logarithm transformation (rlog) (Love et\u00a0al., 2014). Differential expression was completed using DESeq2 with log2 fold change shrinkage (Love et\u00a0al., 2014). Genes with less than 1 read count across samples were pre-filtered. Multiple testing was accounted for using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to calculate false discovery rates (FDRs) (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Principal component analysis (PCA) was completed on the top 500 genes with greatest variance across samples. Where heatmaps of normalized expression are clustered this was completed using Ward\u2019s method and Euclidean distance (Murtagh and Legendre, 2014).\nRNA-seq data processing and differential expression\n            RNA sequencing reads were trimmed with TrimGalore (version 0.5.0) and aligned to a reference genome using the pseudo aligner Kallisto with default parameters (version 0.44.0) (Martin, 2011; Bray et\u00a0al., 2016).

Reported normalized read counts, unless otherwise stated, are as regularised-logarithm transformation (rlog) (Love et\u00a0al., 2014). Differential expression was completed using DESeq2 with log2 fold change shrinkage (Love et\u00a0al., 2014). Genes with less than 1 read count across samples were pre-filtered. Multiple testing was accounted for using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to calculate false discovery rates (FDRs) (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Principal component analysis (PCA) was completed on the top 500 genes with greatest variance across samples. Where heatmaps of normalized expression are clustered this was completed using Ward\u2019s method and Euclidean distance (Murtagh and Legendre, 2014).\nRNA-seq - Identifying genes specific to tumor derived mutants\n          Genes specific to NPE tumor derived (NPE-BL6-TD and NPE-IE), and NF1 mutant samples (NF1, NP, NPE, NPE-BL6-TD, NPE-NSG-TD, NPE-IE) were identified via the Distal binarization approach as previously described (Corces et\u00a0al., 2018). In brief an intra-group median and inter-quartile range (IQR) were calculated for each gene. For each gene, groups were then ranked by median expression across replicates with BL6 WT samples as a baseline. For any gene where the median expression of a group was higher than 1.5 times the IQR than the group preceding it in rank, this gene was labeled specific to this sample group. All samples ranked higher than this group based on gene expression were also labeled as gene specific. Genes were further filtered such that only specific genes that were also differentially expressed (FDR\u00a0< 0.05, LFC > 1) between relevant comparisons (NPE tumor derived samples\u00a0Vs. All others, and NF1 mutant samples Vs. All others) were retained (Love et\u00a0al., 2014).\nRNA-seq - Defining human subtypes\n          Genes with low expression (< 10 counts across all groups, with\u00a0< 1 count per sample) and low variability of counts per million reads (CPM) across GSC samples, as calculated by DESeq2, were filtered (SD\u00a0< 5 across groups, and coefficient of variation\u00a0< 0.25). A final 9291 genes were subsequently used for downstream analysis. The NMF package in R (version 0.22.0) was used to perform the brunet implementation of non-negative matrix factorisation using default parameters (Brunet et\u00a0al., 2004; Gaujoux and Seoighe, 2010). The highest cophenetic score was used as a criterion to obtain the optimal number of latent factors (Subtypes: S1 Non-MESImm, S2 MESImm). Two distinct subtypes were consistently obtained when running NMF with different algorithms and returned the most stable consensus clustering when compared with other rank numbers (Lee and Seung, 2001; Brunet et\u00a0al., 2004; Pascual-Montano et\u00a0al., 2006). To extract gene features for each subtype the most specific genes were selected (S1 Non- MESImm: 589, S2 MESImm: 235 genes) with the Kim and Park method as implemented in the NMF package (Kim and Park, 2007). Subtype enrichment scores were derived as the column normalized S1/S2 score (%) for each sample from the NMF coefficient matrix. For downstream analysis subtype labels (S1 Non-MESImm, or S2 MESImm) were applied to each sample as the subtype with the highest enrichment score.\nRNA-seq - Overrepresentation and gene set enrichment analysis\n          R packages clusterprofiler, (version 3.15.4) and ReactomePA (version 1.31.0) were used to find enriched gene sets for genes specific to tumor derived mouse samples, and human subtypes S1 Non-MESImm, or S2 MESImm (Yu et\u00a0al., 2012; Yu and He, 2016). Where gene ratio is reported this is the number of genes in each pathway or GO term enriched in a gene list of interest (e.g., S1 or S2) divided by the total number of genes in the gene list of interest. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was completed for differentially expressed gene sets via the Broad institute\u2019s GSEA Preranked tool from the GSEA software package 3.0 (Subramanian et\u00a0al., 2005). For human samples the Gene ontology (GO) database for Biological process, Cellular component and Molecular process, was utilized as a gene set database (Harris et\u00a0al., 2004). For mouse samples an equivalent GO database was derived (Lai et\u00a0al., 2016a). Single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), with simplicity scores, was completed using a recent implementation of the ssGSEA algorithm by Wang et\u00a0al., with selected immune GO terms, and glioma subtype gene sets (Mesenchymal, Classical, and Proneural) (Barbie et\u00a0al., 2009; Wang et\u00a0al., 2017).\nReduced representation bisulfite sequencing\n          Reads were trimmed with TrimGalore (version 0.5.0). NuGen diversity adaptors were removed with a Python script supplied by NuGen \u201ctrimRRBSdiversityAdaptCustomers.py\u201d (version 1.11 https://github.com/nugentechnologies/NuMetRRBS) (Martin, 2011). Reads were then aligned to the mm10 in silico bisulfite transformed genome with the bisulphite sequencing aligner Bismark (version 0.16.3 with Bowtie version 2.2.6 using parameters: -N 0 -L 20) (Krueger and Andrews, 2011). PCR duplicates were then removed using a Python script from NuGen \u201cnudup.py\u201d (version 2.3 https://github.com/tecangenomics/nudup). Methylation estimation was completed using the Bismark methylation extractor ignoring the first two bases of read 2 to minimize common methylation call bias at these sites. Initial visualization with PCA was completed on the top 25% of CpGs with the highest variance of percentage methylation. No batch effect was observed following PCA. Identification of differentially methylated loci (DMLs) was completed with the R package DSS (version 2.36.0) in multifactor mode to account for RRBS batch (Park and Wu, 2016). FDR was used to account for multiple testing (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were called by merging adjacent statistically significant DMLs within 50bp of one another, and filtering for DMRs with a minimum length of 50bp and with greater than 3 significant CpG sites. CpG island tracks were retrieved from the UCSC table browser service as a BED file (Karolchik et\u00a0al., 2004). Percentage methylation, DMRs, DMLs, and CpG island tracks were visualized using the IGV genome browser (Thorvaldsd\u00f3ttir et\u00a0al., 2013). The annotation of DMRs was completed using the R package ChIPpeakAnno (version 3.22.0) \u2013 where DMRs were attributed to nearest gene promoter/transcription start site (TSS) (Zhu et\u00a0al., 2010). TSS coordinates were defined as \u00b1 2kb of sequence surrounding the start of the first exon. Promoter rank plots were filtered to include DMRs overlapping promoter regions and associated hypomethylated immune genes were highlighted in blue (> 50% methylation loss, overlapping immune and interferon GO terms: GO:0006955, GO:0034341, GO:0034340, GO:0035456, GO:0035455, and GO:0019882). Density heatmaps were produced using the \u2018densityHeatmap\u2019 function from the R package ComplexHeatmap (version 2.4.2), and clustering was completed using Euclidean distance and Ward\u2019s method (Murtagh and Legendre, 2014; Gu, Eils and Schlesner, 2016).\nInfinium\u00ae MethylationEPIC BeadChip\n          Pre-processing and normalization from idat files to beta values was completed via the R package minfi (version 1.34.0) with combined functional and Noob normalization (Triche et\u00a0al., 2013; Fortin et\u00a0al., 2014, 2017). Poor quality probes, and those that could not be mapped to the hg38 genome, were filtered as previously described (Maksimovic et\u00a0al., 2016; Zhou et\u00a0al., 2017). Classification of human EPIC array samples were completed via the online portal https://www.molecularneuropathology.org/mnp. IDH mutants were removed prior to downstream methylation analysis (Capper et\u00a0al., 2018). DMLs and DMRs were identified via the R Package DMRCate (version 2.2.3) using limma (version 3.43.11) (Peters et\u00a0al., 2015; Ritchie et\u00a0al., 2015). Annotation of DMRs was completed via the R package ChIPpeakAnno by assigning DMRs to nearest TSS (+/\u2212 2kb) (Zhu et\u00a0al., 2010). Density heatmaps were produced using the \u2018densityHeatmap\u2019 function from the R package \u2018ComplexHeatmap\u2019, and clustering was completed using Euclidean distance with Ward\u2019s method (Murtagh and Legendre, 2014; Gu et\u00a0al., 2016).\nSingle-cell RNA-seq\n          Smart-seq2 single cell RNA-seq normalized counts (Transcripts per million, TPM) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) (GEO accession: GSM3828672) for 7930 glioma cells, from 28 separate tumors (Neftel et\u00a0al., 2019). Contaminating cells (Macrophages, T Cells, and Oligodendrocytes) were filtered as previously described (Neftel et\u00a0al., 2019). Paediatric samples were then filtered prior to downstream analysis. PCA was completed on the top 2000 most variable genes. As in the bulk RNA-Seq analysis ssGSEA was completed on each cell for glioma transcriptional subtypes, and immune GO terms. Where subtype labels are applied to individual cells this was completed using ssGSEA - where an S2 MESImm subtype was applied to cells with a MESImm p value\u00a0< 0.05, otherwise a S1 Non-MESImm label was applied. Differential expression between MESImm and Non- MESImm labeled cells was completed using the \u2018findMarkers\u2019 function from the R package scran (version 1.16.0) using default parameters (Lun et\u00a0al., 2016).\nWhole genome sequencing\n          Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of BL6 WT, NPE and NPE-IE lines was completed using the best practises WGS paired cancer normal pipeline bcbio (bcbio-nextgen version 1.2.3) (https://github.com/bcbio/bcbio-nextgen). Adaptors were trimmed with the read trimmer Atropos (version 1.1.25) (Didion et\u00a0al., 2017), a variant of Cutadapt, and aligned to the mm10 genome using the aligner Bowtie2 (version 2.3.5.1) (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). An additional human EGFRvIII contig was included to capture human reads from the EGFRvIII transgene present in NPE and NPE-IE lines. PCR duplicates were marked with samblaster (version 0.1.25) (Faust and Hall, 2014), and GATK base quality score recalibration was completed on the aligned BAM files (gatk version 3.8) (DePristo et\u00a0al., 2011). Single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling was completed using an ensemble-based approach using VarDict (version 1.6), Strelka2 (version 2.9.10), and Mutect2 (gatk version 3.8) for somatic calling, and freebayes (version 1.1.0.46), GATK HaplotypeCaller (gatk version 3.8), and Strelka2 (version 2.9.10) for germline calling (DePristo et\u00a0al., 2011; Garrison and Marth, 2012; Cibulskis et\u00a0al., 2013; Lai et\u00a0al., 2016b; Kim et\u00a0al., 2018). Germline calls were used to filter final somatic calls. Variants were combined and included in the final call if present in 2 out of 3 variant callers (bcbio min_allele_fraction: 2). Variant calls were targeted at exonic regions as defined by the R package TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.knownGene (version 3.4.4). Structural variants (SVs) were called with Manta (version 1.6.0) (Chen et\u00a0al., 2016). Structural variants that did not pass default Manta filters were removed. Break-end (BND) calls for NPE and NPE-IE samples were either imprecise and without split read evidence or had less than 5 split reads for the alternative allele, and hence were not considered for further analysis. Copy number variants (CNVs) were assessed with CNVkit (version 0.9.6) (Talevich et\u00a0al., 2016). To accommodate parameter flexibility, CNVKit was run outside of bcbio using the \u201cwgs\u201d option, targeted at transcript regions as defined by the R package TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.knownGene. Absolute copy number calls were completed with the \u201cclonal\u201d option to account for known high purity of cell line samples and copy number regions were filtered using confidence interval filtering. SNV and SVs were annotated using the R packages VariantAnnotation (version 1.34.0), TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.knownGene, and BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.masked (version 1.3.99) (Obenchain et\u00a0al., 2014). Following annotation SNV calls were filtered again to remove those within noncoding regions, those that were synonymous, as well as those with an allele frequency (AF)\u00a0< 0.25. Final, filtered, SNV, SV, and CNV calls were overlapped with known cancer driver genes as defined by the COSMIC gene census (https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census), converted to mouse homologs via MGI batch query (http://www.informatics.jax.org/batch) (Sondka et\u00a0al., 2018; Bult et\u00a0al., 2019).\nQuantification and statistical analysis\n        Statistical analysis was performed on GraphPad or using R (version 4.0.0). Numerical data presented in charts is displayed as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM and analyzed using unpaired t tests unless otherwise stated in corresponding legends of the article. Statistical analysis of survival data was performed on GraphPad using the Log Rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Significance is noted in figures or figure legends; p values are denoted as follows: \u2217\u00a0< 0.05, \u2217\u2217\u00a0< 0.01, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u00a0< 0.001, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u00a0< 0.0001, n.s. > 0.05.\nSupplemental information\n      \n        \n          \n            Data S1.
