Details for in vitro experiments are provided in Supplementary Material\ns.\n      \n      \n        PBPK modeling and simulation\n        \n          PBPK model development\n          A whole\u2010body PBPK model integrated with a 4Brain model (Figure\n\n1\n) was developed for predicting the system and CNS pharmacokinetics of each CDK4/6 inhibitor, using the Simcyp Simulator V18 (Simcyp Ltd., Sheffield, UK). System\u2010specific parameters were derived from the existing Simcyp virtual cancer patient population, unless stated otherwise. Drug\u2010specific parameters are summarized in Table\n\n1\n. The model development is described in detail in Supplementary Material\ns.\n          \n            Figure 1\n            \n              Model structure of the whole\u2010body physiologically\u2010based pharmacokinetic model integrated with a 4\u2010compartment permeability\u2010limited brain (4Brain) model, which has 4 compartments representing the brain blood, brain mass, cranial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and spinal CSF. The 4Brain model assumes: (1) drug transport across the blood\u2010brain barrier (BBB) is governed by bidirectional passive permeability (PSB) and ABCB1\u2010mediated and ABCG2\u2010mediated active efflux clearance (CLefflux,BBB); (2) drug transport across the blood\u2010CSF barrier was controlled by bidirectional PSB and ABCB1\u2010mediated active influx clearance (CLuptake,CSF); (3) drug transport between the brain mass and cranial CSF is diffusive transport at a bi\u2010directional clearance (PSB); (4) fluid balance is maintained by the circulation of CSF between spinal and cranial compartments and reabsorbed into the brain blood; (5) the cerebral blood flow rate (Q\nBrain) links the 4Brain model to whole\u2010body model; (6) only unbound and unionized drug can passively pass through all barriers, while transporters act upon unbound drug (including both unionized and ionized species); (7) metabolism in brain mass is negligible; and (8) all compartments are well\u2010stirred with defined volumes. Flow rates are described by the CSF secretion rate (Q\nBCSFB), bulk flow rate from brain mass to cranial CSF (Q\nbulk), CSF flow rate out of cranial and spinal compartments (Q\nsink), CSF shuttle flow rate between cranial and spinal compartments (Q\nSin and Q\nSout), and water transfer rate from the brain blood to brain mass (Q\nBBB).\n            \n            \n          \n          \n

concentration\u2014time profiles of each CDK4/6 inhibitor in the plasma, brain, and CSF were predicted in a Simcyp virtual cancer population by simulations of 10 trials with 10 subjects in each trial. The dosing regimens for simulations were matched to the FDA\u2010approved standard dose regimens or that used in the published clinical trials. The developed PBPK models were verified by comparing the model\u2010predicted plasma and CNS pharmacokinetics with the observed clinical plasma and CNS (if available) data.\n        \n        \n          Simulations\n          To assist the design of optimal dosing regimens, simulations of 10 trials with 10 patients with cancer in each trial were performed to predict the plasma and CNS pharmacokinetics of each CDK4/6 inhibitor following the FDA\u2010approved standard and modified dosing regimens. The standard dosing regimen for ribociclib is 600\u00a0mg q.d. oral dosing on a 3\u2010weeks\u2010on/1\u2010week\u2010off schedule; for palbociclib is 125\u00a0mg q.d. oral dosing on a 3\u2010weeks\u2010on/1\u2010week\u2010off schedule; and for abemaciclib is 150\u00a0mg b.i.d. oral dosing on a 4\u2010weeks\u2010on continuous schedule. Modified dosing evaluated were 900\u00a0mg q.d. (maximum tolerated dose) for ribociclib, 187.5\u00a0mg q.d. (50% increase of the standard dose) for palbociclib, and 300\u00a0mg q.d. for abemaciclib.\nIn vivo\u2010in vitro relative activity factor of ABCB1 and ABCG2\n          Quantitative proteomics analyses of 30 human normal brain and 47 glioblastoma samples suggest that the median protein abundances of ABCB1 and ABCG2 are 3.38 and 6.21\u00a0pmol/mg in human normal brain microvessels, respectively; and their respective levels are reduced to 0.14 and 1.69\u00a0pmol/mg in human glioblastoma microvessels.\n20\n In the cell membranes of MDCKII\u2010ABCB1 and MDCKII\u2010ABCG2 cell lines, ABCB1 and ABCG2 protein abundances are 10.3 and 13.2\u00a0pmol/mg, respectively.\n20\n The mean recovery of microvessels isolated from human normal brain and glioblastoma is 0.19 and 0.31\u00a0mg per gram tissue, respectively.\n20\n Based on these data and given an average brain weight of 1,400\u00a0g, the relative activity factor (RAF) for ABCB1 and ABCG2 was determined to be 87.3 and 125.1\u00a0mg at the intact human BBB, respectively, whereas being 5.88 and 55.5\u00a0mg at the BBB in glioblastoma.\n          ABCB1 has been located at the apical (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) facing) membrane of the blood\u2010cranial CSF barrier, and therefore ABCB1\u2010mediated active influx from the blood to cranial CSF was considered at the blood\u2010cranial CSF barrier. However, ABCB1 protein abundance data at this barrier is not available, and thus the RAF for ABCB1\u2010mediated active influx clearance at the blood\u2010CSF barrier was assigned and verified by the observed clinical CSF data of ribociclib.\nPBPK modeling and simulation\n        \n          PBPK model development\n          A whole\u2010body PBPK model integrated with a 4Brain model (Figure\n\n1\n) was developed for predicting the system and CNS pharmacokinetics of each CDK4/6 inhibitor, using the Simcyp Simulator V18 (Simcyp Ltd., Sheffield, UK). System\u2010specific parameters were derived from the existing Simcyp virtual cancer patient population, unless stated otherwise. Drug\u2010specific parameters are summarized in Table\n\n1\n. The model development is described in detail in Supplementary Material\ns.\n          \n            Figure 1\n            \n              Model structure of the whole\u2010body physiologically\u2010based pharmacokinetic model integrated with a 4\u2010compartment permeability\u2010limited brain (4Brain) model, which has 4 compartments representing the brain blood, brain mass, cranial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and spinal CSF. The 4Brain model assumes: (1) drug transport across the blood\u2010brain barrier (BBB) is governed by bidirectional passive permeability (PSB) and ABCB1\u2010mediated and ABCG2\u2010mediated active efflux clearance (CLefflux,BBB); (2) drug transport across the blood\u2010CSF barrier was controlled by bidirectional PSB and ABCB1\u2010mediated active influx clearance (CLuptake,CSF); (3) drug transport between the brain mass and cranial CSF is diffusive transport at a bi\u2010directional clearance (PSB); (4) fluid balance is maintained by the circulation of CSF between spinal and cranial compartments and reabsorbed into the brain blood; (5) the cerebral blood flow rate (Q\nBrain) links the 4Brain model to whole\u2010body model; (6) only unbound and unionized drug can passively pass through all barriers, while transporters act upon unbound drug (including both unionized and ionized species); (7) metabolism in brain mass is negligible; and (8) all compartments are well\u2010stirred with defined volumes. Flow rates are described by the CSF secretion rate (Q\nBCSFB), bulk flow rate from brain mass to cranial CSF (Q\nbulk), CSF flow rate out of cranial and spinal compartments (Q\nsink), CSF shuttle flow rate between cranial and spinal compartments (Q\nSin and Q\nSout), and water transfer rate from the brain blood to brain mass (Q\nBBB).\n            \n            \n          \n          \n

concentration\u2014time profiles of each CDK4/6 inhibitor in the plasma, brain, and CSF were predicted in a Simcyp virtual cancer population by simulations of 10 trials with 10 subjects in each trial. The dosing regimens for simulations were matched to the FDA\u2010approved standard dose regimens or that used in the published clinical trials. The developed PBPK models were verified by comparing the model\u2010predicted plasma and CNS pharmacokinetics with the observed clinical plasma and CNS (if available) data.\n        \n        \n          Simulations\n          To assist the design of optimal dosing regimens, simulations of 10 trials with 10 patients with cancer in each trial were performed to predict the plasma and CNS pharmacokinetics of each CDK4/6 inhibitor following the FDA\u2010approved standard and modified dosing regimens. The standard dosing regimen for ribociclib is 600\u00a0mg q.d. oral dosing on a 3\u2010weeks\u2010on/1\u2010week\u2010off schedule; for palbociclib is 125\u00a0mg q.d. oral dosing on a 3\u2010weeks\u2010on/1\u2010week\u2010off schedule; and for abemaciclib is 150\u00a0mg b.i.d. oral dosing on a 4\u2010weeks\u2010on continuous schedule. Modified dosing evaluated were 900\u00a0mg q.d. (maximum tolerated dose) for ribociclib, 187.5\u00a0mg q.d. (50% increase of the standard dose) for palbociclib, and 300\u00a0mg q.d. for abemaciclib.\nPBPK model development\n          A whole\u2010body PBPK model integrated with a 4Brain model (Figure\n\n1\n) was developed for predicting the system and CNS pharmacokinetics of each CDK4/6 inhibitor, using the Simcyp Simulator V18 (Simcyp Ltd., Sheffield, UK). System\u2010specific parameters were derived from the existing Simcyp virtual cancer patient population, unless stated otherwise. Drug\u2010specific parameters are summarized in Table\n\n1\n. The model development is described in detail in Supplementary Material\ns.\n          \n            Figure 1\n            \n              Model structure of the whole\u2010body physiologically\u2010based pharmacokinetic model integrated with a 4\u2010compartment permeability\u2010limited brain (4Brain) model, which has 4 compartments representing the brain blood, brain mass, cranial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and spinal CSF. The 4Brain model assumes: (1) drug transport across the blood\u2010brain barrier (BBB) is governed by bidirectional passive permeability (PSB) and ABCB1\u2010mediated and ABCG2\u2010mediated active efflux clearance (CLefflux,BBB); (2) drug transport across the blood\u2010CSF barrier was controlled by bidirectional PSB and ABCB1\u2010mediated active influx clearance (CLuptake,CSF); (3) drug transport between the brain mass and cranial CSF is diffusive transport at a bi\u2010directional clearance (PSB); (4) fluid balance is maintained by the circulation of CSF between spinal and cranial compartments and reabsorbed into the brain blood; (5) the cerebral blood flow rate (Q\nBrain) links the 4Brain model to whole\u2010body model; (6) only unbound and unionized drug can passively pass through all barriers, while transporters act upon unbound drug (including both unionized and ionized species); (7) metabolism in brain mass is negligible; and (8) all compartments are well\u2010stirred with defined volumes. Flow rates are described by the CSF secretion rate (Q\nBCSFB), bulk flow rate from brain mass to cranial CSF (Q\nbulk), CSF flow rate out of cranial and spinal compartments (Q\nsink), CSF shuttle flow rate between cranial and spinal compartments (Q\nSin and Q\nSout), and water transfer rate from the brain blood to brain mass (Q\nBBB).\n            \n            \n          \n          \n

           \n            \n              John Wiley & Sons, Ltd\nModel verification\n          The total and unbound drug concentration\u2014time profiles of each CDK4/6 inhibitor in the plasma, brain, and CSF were predicted in a Simcyp virtual cancer population by simulations of 10 trials with 10 subjects in each trial. The dosing regimens for simulations were matched to the FDA\u2010approved standard dose regimens or that used in the published clinical trials. The developed PBPK models were verified by comparing the model\u2010predicted plasma and CNS pharmacokinetics with the observed clinical plasma and CNS (if available) data.\nSimulations\n          To assist the design of optimal dosing regimens, simulations of 10 trials with 10 patients with cancer in each trial were performed to predict the plasma and CNS pharmacokinetics of each CDK4/6 inhibitor following the FDA\u2010approved standard and modified dosing regimens. The standard dosing regimen for ribociclib is 600\u00a0mg q.d. oral dosing on a 3\u2010weeks\u2010on/1\u2010week\u2010off schedule; for palbociclib is 125\u00a0mg q.d. oral dosing on a 3\u2010weeks\u2010on/1\u2010week\u2010off schedule; and for abemaciclib is 150\u00a0mg b.i.d. oral dosing on a 4\u2010weeks\u2010on continuous schedule. Modified dosing evaluated were 900\u00a0mg q.d. (maximum tolerated dose) for ribociclib, 187.5\u00a0mg q.d. (50% increase of the standard dose) for palbociclib, and 300\u00a0mg q.d. for abemaciclib.\nRESULTS\n      \n        Drug\u2010specific parameters\n        \n          \nIn vitro metabolic kinetics\n          The overall metabolic kinetics of ribociclib, palbociclib, and abemaciclib in human liver and intestinal microsomes were well\u2010described by Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics (Figure\n\nS1\n). The estimated in vitro metabolic kinetic parameters, including the maximum metabolic velocity (Vmax), substrate concentration at which 50% of Vmax is obtained (K\nm), and in vitro intrinsic metabolic clearance (CLint) estimated as Vmax/K\nm, are summarized in Table\n\n1\n and were used for predicting the whole\u2010organ liver and intestine metabolic clearance in the PBPK models.\n        \n        \n          Binding to patient plasma proteins and brain tumor tissues\n          In the plasma of patients with cancer, ribociclib and palbociclib were bound to plasma proteins to a similar extent, with the mean fraction unbound in plasma (f\nu,p) 0.125 and 0.126, respectively, whereas abemaciclib had higher plasma binding (mean f\nu,p, 0.06). Similarly, abemaciclib showed the highest binding to human brain tumor tissues with the mean fraction unbound in brain tissue (f\nu,br) 0.006, followed by palbociclib (mean f\nu,br, 0.015) and ribociclib (mean f\nu,br, 0.044).\n        \n        \n          Passive transcellular permeability\n          The three CDK4/6 inhibitors exhibited similar apical\u2010to\u2010basolateral apparent transcellular passive permeability (P\napp,A\u2010B) across MDCKII cell monolayers at pH 7.4 in both apical and basolateral chambers (Table\n\n2\n). Based on pH partition theory (Henderson\u2013Hasselbalch equation), the unionization efficiency (\u03bb) at pH 7.4 for ribociclib (PKa, 8.87), palbociclib (PKa, 8.86), and abemaciclib (PKa, 7.94) was estimated to be 0.033, 0.034, and 0.224, respectively. Because only unbound and unionized drugs pass through biological membranes, the intrinsic passive transcellular permeability (P\napp,A\u2010B/\u03bb) for unionized drugs were estimated (Table\n\n2\n), and were then scaled to the human brain microvasculature surface area to predict the BBB passive permeability clearance (PSB) of the unbound and unionized drug in the PBPK model (Table\n\n1\n).\n          \n            Table 2\n            \n              Transcellular permeability and efflux ratios of the three CDK4/6 inhibitors, determined from the parental MDCKII, MDCKII\u2010ABCB1, and MDCKII\u2010ABCG2 cell monolayers\n            \n            \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                  Ribociclib\n                  Palbociclib\n                  Abemaciclib\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  Parental MDCKII\n                \n                \n                  Apparent permeability (P\napp,A\u2010B) (\u00d710\u22126\u00a0cm/s)\na\n\n\n                  7.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.85\n                  9.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.16\n                  9.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.21\n                \n                \n                  Net efflux ratio\nb\n\n\n                  1.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.21\n                  1.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17\n                  1.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.30\n                \n                \n                  Unionization efficiency (\u03bb)\nc\n\n\n                  0.033\n                  0.034\n                  0.224\n                \n                \n                  Intrinsic permeability (P\napp,A\u2010B/\u03bb)\nd\n\n\n                  218.6\n                  280.0\n                  40.6\n                \n                \n                  MDCKII\u2010ABCB1\n                \n                \n                  Apparent permeability (P\napp,A\u2010B) (\u00d710\u22126\u00a0cm/s)\na\n\n\n                  1.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.82\n                  5.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.10\n                  5.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.86\n                \n                \n                  Net efflux ratio\nb\n\n\n                  10.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.30\n                  5.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.04\n                  2.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.49\n                \n                \n                  MDCKII\u2010ABCG2\n                \n                \n                  Apparent permeability P\napp,A\u2010B (\u00d710\u22126\u00a0cm/s)\na\n\n\n                  5.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.91\n                  7.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25\n                  7.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.42\n                \n                \n                  Net efflux ratio\nb\n\n\n                  1.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.20\n                  2.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.05\n                  1.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                Data are expressed as the mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD from at least three independent experiments (with duplicates in each experiment).\n              \n              \n                \n                  a\n                \n                Bidirectional permeability experiments were performed at pH 7.4 in both apical and basolateral chambers.\n              \n              \n                \n                  b\n                \n                Net efflux ratio was the efflux ratio in the absence of an ABCB1 inhibitor (elacridar) or ABCG2 inhibitor (Ko145) divided by the efflux ratio in the presence of the inhibitor.\n              \n              \n                \n                  c\n                \n                Unionization efficiency (\u03bb) is the ratio of unionized form to total drug (the sum of unionized and ionized forms), where the unionized\u2010to\u2010ionized ratio is calculated based on Henderson\u2010Hasselbalch equation: Log10baseor unionizedacidionized=pH\u2010PKa.\n              \n              \n                \n                  d\n                \n                Intrinsic permeability is the transcellular permeability of the unbound and unionized drug, estimated as the mean P\napp,A\u2010B normalized by \u03bb.\n              \n            \n            \n              John Wiley & Sons, Ltd\n            \n          \n          The three CDK4/6 inhibitors are weak base drugs. Similar to AZD1775 (a weak base drug),\n19\n the three CDK4/6 inhibitors exhibited pH\u2010dependent apparent permeability across the MDCKII, MDCKII\u2010ABCB1, and MDCKII\u2010ABCG2 cell monolayers (Figure\n\n2\n). As the pH decreased (7.4, 7.0, 6.5, and 6.0) in the basolateral chamber (mimicking brain/brain tumor interstitium) whereas remaining the same (7.4) in the apical chamber (mimicking blood circulation), the apparent permeability increased in the apical\u2010to\u2010basolateral direction while decreasing in the basolateral\u2010to\u2010apical direction, overall resulting in reduced efflux ratios (Figure\n\n2\n). This observation was in accordance with the pH partition theory. At a relatively acidic basolateral pH, the ionization of a weak base drug was increased, and, as a result, the basolateral\u2010to\u2010apical permeability decreased and apical\u2010to\u2010basolateral permeability increased, thus leading to the trap of ionized drugs in the basolateral compartment.\n          \n            Figure 2\n            \n              The pH\u2010dependent apparent permeability of the three cyclin D\u2010cyclin dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors across the MDCKII, MDCKII\u2010ABCB1, and MDCKII\u2010ABCG2 cell monolayers. Bi\u2010directional permeability experiments were performed at a fixed apical pH (7.4) and varying basolateral pH (7.4, 7.0, 6.5, and 6.0). The apparent permeability in the apical\u2010to\u2010basolateral (P\napp,A\u2010B) and basolateral\u2010to\u2010apical (P\napp,B\u2010A) directions and efflux ratio (ER) are expressed as the mean fold change relative to those determined in the control (at pH 7.4 in both apical and basolateral chambers).\n            \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          ABCB1\u2010mediated and ABCG2\u2010mediated intrinsic efflux clearance\n          MDCKII cells with stable expression of ABCB1 or ABCG2 were used to determine the interactions of CDK4/6 inhibitors with ABCB1 and ABCG2, two major efflux transporters that are expressed at the human BBB. The positive controls, loperamide (a typical ABCB1 substrate) and gefitinib (a typical ABCG2 substrate) exhibited a mean net efflux ratio of 6.11 and 8.86 on MDCKII\u2010ABCB1 and MDCKII\u2010ABCG2 cell monolayers, respectively, confirming the functional expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2 in these cellular models. All three CDK4/6 inhibitors were ABCB1 substrates, whereas ABCB1 efflux efficiency appeared the highest for ribociclib (net efflux ratio 10.5), followed by palbociclib (net efflux ratio 5.92) and abemaciclib (net efflux ratio 2.84; Table\n\n2\n). Palbociclib was a substrate of ABCG2 (net efflux ratio 2.64), but ribociclib and abemaciclib were not good substrates for ABCG2 (net efflux ratio 1.02 and 1.21, respectively; Table\n\n2\n). Based on the intrinsic transcellular passive permeability and net efflux ratio, in vitro ABCB1\u2010mediated intrinsic efflux clearance was determined to be 4,354, 5,232, and 160\u00a0\u00b5L/min/mg for ribociclib, palbociclib, and abemaciclib, respectively, and the respective in vitro ABCG2 intrinsic efflux clearance was 0, 1,716, and 18\u00a0\u00b5L/min/mg (Table\n\n1\n). These values were then scaled by IVIVE strategy to predict in vivo ABCB1\u2010mediated and ABCG2\u2010mediated efflux clearance at the BBB.\n        \n        \n          \nIn vivo\u2010in vitro relative activity factor of ABCB1 and ABCG2\n          Quantitative proteomics analyses of 30 human normal brain and 47 glioblastoma samples suggest that the median protein abundances of ABCB1 and ABCG2 are 3.38 and 6.21\u00a0pmol/mg in human normal brain microvessels, respectively; and their respective levels are reduced to 0.14 and 1.69\u00a0pmol/mg in human glioblastoma microvessels.\n20\n In the cell membranes of MDCKII\u2010ABCB1 and MDCKII\u2010ABCG2 cell lines, ABCB1 and ABCG2 protein abundances are 10.3 and 13.2\u00a0pmol/mg, respectively.\n20\n The mean recovery of microvessels isolated from human normal brain and glioblastoma is 0.19 and 0.31\u00a0mg per gram tissue, respectively.\n20\n Based on these data and given an average brain weight of 1,400\u00a0g, the relative activity factor (RAF) for ABCB1 and ABCG2 was determined to be 87.3 and 125.1\u00a0mg at the intact human BBB, respectively, whereas being 5.88 and 55.5\u00a0mg at the BBB in glioblastoma.\n          ABCB1 has been located at the apical (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) facing) membrane of the blood\u2010cranial CSF barrier, and therefore ABCB1\u2010mediated active influx from the blood to cranial CSF was considered at the blood\u2010cranial CSF barrier. However, ABCB1 protein abundance data at this barrier is not available, and thus the RAF for ABCB1\u2010mediated active influx clearance at the blood\u2010CSF barrier was assigned and verified by the observed clinical CSF data of ribociclib.\n        \n      \n      \n        PBPK modeling and simulations\n        \n          Model verification for prediction of plasma pharmacokinetics\n          Following the dosing regimen (900\u00a0mg q.d. for 5\u00a0days) as used in the clinical trial, the PBPK model well\u2010predicted ribociclib mean plasma concentration time profiles and interindividual variabilities, as demonstrated by >\u00a098% of observed plasma concentration data falling within the 5th and 95th percentiles of the simulated population mean profile (Figure\n\n3\n\na). The model\u2010simulated population mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of ribociclib were 1.03\u2010fold and 0.90\u2010fold of the respective observed parameters (i.e., predicted vs. observed Cmax, 3.87 vs. 3.75\u00a0\u00b5mol/L; CL/F, 55.5 vs. 61.6\u00a0L/h).\n12\n\n\n          \n            Figure 3\n            \n              Physiologically\u2010based pharmacokinetic model\u2010simulated and clinically observed plasma and central nervous system (CNS) pharmacokinetics of ribociclib.

Simulations of 10 trials with 10 subjects in each were performed in the Simcyp virtual cancer patient population following 5\u2010day ribociclib treatment at a daily oral dose of 900\u00a0mg. Observed clinical plasma and CNS pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 12 glioblastoma patients treated with ribociclib (900\u00a0mg q.d. for 5\u00a0days).\n            \n            \n          \n          Similarly, the developed PBPK models well\u2010predicted the plasma pharmacokinetics of palbociclib and abemaciclib. The simulated population mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters were within 0.90\u20131.15\u2010fold of the respective parameters estimated by population pharmacokinetic modeling analysis of observed data in patients with cancer.\n21\n, \n22\n Specifically, the predicted vs. observed palbociclib CL/F was 59.4 vs. 63.1\u00a0L/hour, elimination half\u2010life (T\n1/2) was 30 vs. 29\u00a0hours, apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was 2,283 vs. 2,342\u00a0L, and oral bioavailability (F) was 0.47 vs. 0.46. The predicted vs. observed abemaciclib CL/F was 35.9 vs. 36.0\u00a0L/hour, T\n1/2 was 22 vs. 20\u00a0hours, V/F was 1,041 vs. 1,050\u00a0L, and F was 0.52 vs. 0.45.\n        \n        \n          Model verification for prediction of CNS pharmacokinetics\n          Given the availability of ribociclib CNS pharmacokinetic data (i.e., CSF and tumor concentrations) observed in patients with glioblastoma,\n12\n the 4Brain model was first developed and verified for the prediction of CNS pharmacokinetics of ribociclib. The simulated ribociclib CSF concentrations were in line with observed CSF data in patients with glioblastoma, with all except for one observed data falling within the 5th and 95th percentiles of the simulated population mean profile (Figure\n\n3\n\nb). The model\u2010predicted population mean CSF\u2010to\u2010unbound plasma ratio (CSF Kp,uu, 1.6) was 0.9\u2010fold of the observed median CSF K\np,uu (1.8) in 12 patients with glioblastoma.\n12\n\n\n          The physical and biochemical barriers of the BBB in glioblastomas are often disrupted, as indicated by leaky tight junctions and loss or significant reduction in protein expression of major BBB efflux transporters.\n20\n It has been reported that the median protein abundances of ABCB1 and ABCG2 in glioblastoma microvessels are reduced to 3.7% and 35% of the normal levels, respectively.\n20\n In addition, electrode measurements of pH in human brain tumors are as low as 5.9 with a mean around 6.8; whereas, normal human brain maintains a pH at ~\u00a07.1\u20137.2.\n23\n, \n24\n, \n25\n As demonstrated by the in vitro pH\u2010dependent apparent permeability data (Figure\n\n2\n), the relative acidic tumor environment would be favorable to the tumor penetration and trap of weak base drugs, regardless whether they are the substrates of ABCB1/ABCG2. The regional pH difference in the normal brain and brain tumors may contribute to the heterogeneous brain/tumor distribution of CDK4/6 inhibitors. Therefore, to predict ribociclib concentrations in the human normal brain as well as in contrast non\u2010enhancing and enhancing tumor regions of glioblastoma, different ABCB1/ABCG2 protein abundances at the BBB and varying brain pH were applied in the simulations following the dosing regimen used in the clinical trial (900\u00a0mg q.d. for 5\u00a0days; Figure\n\n3\n\nc\u2010f). In the normal brain with an intact BBB (i.e., brain pH 7.12, ABCB1 abundance 3.38\u00a0pmol/mg), the simulated population mean steady\u2010state average concentration (C\nss,ave) of unbound ribociclib was 0.036\u00a0\u00b5mol/L and unbound brain\u2010to\u2010plasma ratio (K\np,uu) was 0.14 (Figure\n\n3\n\nc). In brain tumors with increasing BBB disruption, specifically in brain tumors with (i) pH 6.8 and ABCB1 abundance 0.14\u00a0pmol/mg (Figure\n\n3\n\nd), (ii) pH 6.8 and loss of ABCB1 expression (Figure\n\n3\n\ne), and (iii) pH 6.5 and loss of ABCB1 expression (Figure\n\n3\n\nf), the simulated population mean C\nss,ave of unbound ribociclib was 0.453, 2.608, 5.096\u00a0\u00b5mol/L, respectively, and the respective K\np,uu was 1.84, 10.6, and 20.8. Notably, the predicted ribociclib tumor concentrations and extent of tumor penetration (K\np,uu) were in accordance with the observed data in non\u2010enhancing and enhancing tumor regions in patients with glioblastoma, showing the observed median (range) unbound ribociclib tumor concentrations of 0.458 (0.015\u20131.295) \u00b5mol/L and 1.644 (0.307\u20134.743) \u00b5mol/L, respectively, and the observed K\np,uu of 1.8 (0.7\u201311.3) and 10.1 (2.4\u201337.4), respectively.\n12\n Collectively, these data suggested that the developed 4Brain model well\u2010predicted the CNS pharmacokinetics of ribociclib as observed in patients with glioblastoma. Therefore, the system\u2010specific parameters for the 4Brain model (e.g., the transporter RAFs at the BBB and blood\u2010CSF barrier) were verified, and could be confidently applied to predict the CNS pharmacokinetics of palbociclib and abemaciclib (for which no or limited clinical CNS data were available).\n          The model\u2010simulated steady\u2010state concentrations of unbound abemaciclib and palbociclib in the human normal brain and CSF are summarized in Table\n\n3\n. For abemaciclib, limited CSF data were obtained from 10 patients following varying dosing regimens (i.e., daily or twice daily oral dosing at 50\u2013275\u00a0mg for 15\u00a0days).\n14\n A direct comparison between the observed and predicted abemaciclib CSF data was not feasible because of varying dosing regimens and varying sampling times in the reported clinical study. Nevertheless, the observed abemaciclib CSF concentrations (range, 0.004\u20130.030\u00a0\u00b5mol/L) generally overlapped with the predicted data (population mean C\nss,ave, 0.038\u00a0\u00b5mol/L; 5th and 95th percentiles, 0.013\u20130.091\u00a0\u00b5mol/L) following the standard dosing regimen (150\u00a0mg b.i.d. for 28\u00a0days). In addition, the predicted mean CSF K\np,uu was 1.10\u2010fold of the observed data (predicted vs. observed mean, 0.77 vs. 0.70).\n          \n            Table 3\n            \n              PBPK

Preclinical studies showed that the brain penetration of palbociclib (K\np,uu, 0.01 in rats and mice) was ~\u00a010\u2010fold less than that of abemaciclib (K\np,uu, 0.11 in rats and 0.17 in mice).\n15\n Despite the species difference in the absolute K\np,uu values between humans and rodents, the model\u2010predicted 10\u2010fold less brain penetration of palbociclib than abemaciclib in humans (K\np,uu, 0.12 vs. 1.04) was consistent with preclinical observation. The brain penetration of ABCB1 substrates is expected to be larger in humans than rodents because ABCB1 protein abundance is significantly lower at the human BBB than rodent BBB and also because of species difference in the CSF dynamics and brain physiology.\n20\n, \n26\n For example, the brain penetration (K\np,uu) of ABCB1 substrate drugs (including verapamil, GR205171, altanserin, and AZD1775) has been reported to be several to over 10\u2010fold greater in humans than in rodents.\n19\n, \n27\n, \n28\n\n\n        \n        \n          Comparison of the CNS pharmacokinetics among the three CDK4/6 inhibitors\n          Ribocliclib and palbociclib are similar with respect to the chemical structure, physicochemical properties, binding to plasma proteins and brain tissues, as well as intrinsic passive transcellular permeability and intrinsic active efflux clearance; whereas abemaciclib is significantly dissimilar than either one (Table\n\n1\n and Table\n\n2\n). Therefore, it was not surprising that the CNS pharmacokinetics of abemaciclib was different from the other two CDK4/6 inhibitors, which was characterized by a slower brain penetration but to a larger extent (Figure\n\n4\n\na\u2010c). It is known that the rate of drug brain penetration is largely driven by the drug binding to brain tissue and passive or active efflux clearance at the BBB. Specifically, higher brain tissue binding and lower passive or active efflux clearance at the BBB lead to slower brain penetration.\n19\n Hence, the slower brain penetration of abemaciclib was expected given its significantly higher brain tissue binding and lower passive and active efflux clearance at the BBB as compared with ribociclib and palbociclib.\n          \n            Figure 4\n            \n              Physiologically\u2010based pharmacokinetic model\u2010simulated plasma and central nervous system pharmacokinetics of the three cyclin D\u2010cyclin dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors following varying dosing regimens.

Simulations of 10 trials with 10 subjects in each trial were performed in the Simcyp virtual cancer patient population.\n            \n            \n          \n          Despite slow brain penetration, abemaciclib penetrated into the brain to a larger extent than the other two CDK4/6 inhibitors. The PBPK models predicted that ribociclib and palbociclib shared a similar brain K\np,uu (~\u00a00.14 vs. 0.12), whereas abemaciclib had a K\np,uu of ~\u00a01.0 (Table\n\n3\n). It is known that the K\np,uu (the extent of brain penetration) is determined by the relative contribution of passive clearance and transporter\u2010mediated active clearance at the BBB.\n29\n If the BBB transport of a drug is dominated by passive permeability, the K\np,uu would approach 1; whereas when a drug is actively transported by efflux or uptake transporters at the BBB, the K\np,uu would be smaller or larger than 1.0. Although the three CDK4/6 inhibitors were ABCB1 substrates, abemaciclib showed ~\u00a030\u2010fold lower ABCB1\u2010mediated intrinsic efflux clearance as compared with ribociclib and palbociclib (Table\n\n1\n). In addition, although palbociclib and abemaciclib were identified as the substrates for mouse abcg2,\n15\n our study suggested that palbociclib was a substrate of human ABCG2, but ribociclib and abemaciclib were not, at least not good substrates for human ABCG2 (Table\n\n2\n). ABCB1 and ABCG2 are two predominant efflux transporters at the human BBB, acting synergistically to restrict the brain penetration of dual ABCB1/ABCG2 substrates.\n30\n, \n31\n, \n32\n Palbociclib was a dual substrate for ABCB1 and ABCG2, whereas ribociclib and abemaciclib appeared to be transported mainly by ABCB1. Collectively, the IVIVE predicted that the overall efflux transporter\u2010mediated in vivo efflux clearance at the human BBB was 1.0\u00a0L/hour for abemaciclib, 22.8\u00a0L/hour for ribociclib, and 40.3\u00a0L/hour for palbociclib, which accounted for 0.2\u2010fold, 6.4\u2010fold, and 4.9\u2010fold of their respective BBB passive clearance at a normal brain pH. These data suggested that the BBB transport of abemaciclib was dominated by passive permeability, whereas the BBB transport of ribociclib and palbociclib was dominated by active efflux.\n          Also noted was that the CSF pharmacokinetics of abemaciclib was different from the other two CDK4/6 inhibitors (Figure\n\n4\n\na\u2010c). The predicted mean CSF\u2010to\u2010unbound plasma ratio of abemaciclib (CSF K\np,uu, 0.8) was close to its brain K\np,uu (1.0), indicating that abemaciclib CSF concentration could be used as a surrogate for unbound brain concentration. By contrary, the predicted CSF K\np,uu of ribociclib (~\u00a01.6) and palbociclib (~\u00a01.8) was >\u00a010\u2010fold of their respective brain K\np,uu, consistent with the predicted ~\u00a010\u2010fold higher CSF concentrations than their respective unbound brain concentrations (Table\n\n3\n). Drug penetration from the circulation blood to CSF is controlled by the blood\u2010CSF barrier, which is formed by the choroid plexus epithelial cells and the arachnoid membrane.\n33\n ABCB1 expression has been identified on the apical, CSF\u2010facing side of the blood\u2010CSF barrier, suggesting that ABCB1 facilitates the transport of substrates into the CSF.\n34\n, \n35\n Therefore, the dominant ABCB1\u2010mediated active CSF uptake of ribociclib and palbociclib at the blood\u2010CSF barrier resulted in CSF K\np,uu\u00a0>\u00a01.0. By contrary, ABCB1 played a minor role in the BBB or CSF penetration of abemaciclib because of the insignificant ABCB1 intrinsic clearance of abemaciclib. The PBPK model predictions supported the notion that CSF concentrations may be useful as a reflection of unbound drug brain concentrations for drugs (e.g., abemaciclib) that pass the BBB and blood\u2010CSF barrier mainly by passive transcellular permeability, whereas for drugs (e.g., ribociclib and palbociclib) that undergo dominant active transport at the BBB and blood\u2010CSF barrier, the relationship between unbound drug brain and CSF concentrations may not be obvious.\n36\n\n\n        \n        \n          Refining dosing regimens\n          Target engagement ratio, defined as the ratio of the average steady\u2010state unbound drug brain concentration to the in vitro IC50 for CDK4/6 inhibition, was used as a crude predictor of efficacy.\n15\n Theoretically, a target engagement ratio \u2265\u00a01 would lead to 50% or greater inhibition of CDK4/6. Abemaciclib is the most potent CDK4/6 inhibitor (with the in vitro IC50 of 2 and 10\u00a0nM for inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6, respectively) as compared with palbociclib (IC50, 11 and 15\u00a0nM) and ribociclib (IC50, 10 and 39\u00a0nM).\n13\n Simulations following the standard dosing regimens suggested that the predicted population mean brain C\nss,ave of unbound ribociclib, palbociclib, and abemaciclib were 0.024, 0.004, and 0.052\u00a0\u00b5mol/L, respectively, and correspondingly the CDK4/6 target engagement ratios were 2.4/0.62 for ribociclib, 0.36/0.27 for palbociclib, and 26/5.2 for abemaciclib (Table\n\n3\n). Based on the criterion of target engagement ratio \u2265\u00a01 required for potential clinical efficacy, abemaciclib achieved adequate inhibition for CDK4 and CDK6 in the human brain at the standard dosing regimen (150\u00a0mg b.i.d.). However, ribociclib may sufficiently inhibit CDK4, but not CDK6 in the brain at the standard dosing regimen (600\u00a0mg q.d.). Palbociclib did not achieve adequate brain concentrations to inhibit CDK4 or CDK6 following the standard dosing regimen (125\u00a0mg q.d.).\n          Additional simulations were performed to refine dosing regimens (Figure\n\n4\n). Following 21\u2010day treatment of ribociclib at the maximum tolerated dose (900\u00a0mg q.d.), the simulated population mean brain Css,ave of unbound ribociclib was 0.036\u00a0\u00b5mol/L and the corresponding CDK4/6 target engagement ratios were 3.6/0.92 (Table\n\n3\n), indicating that the treatment of ribociclib at the maximum tolerated dose may sufficiently inhibit both CDK4 and CDK6. However, palbociclib did not achieve sufficient brain concentration for CDK4/6 inhibition (target engagement ratios <\u00a00.5) even at a dose 50% higher than the standard dose (Table\n\n3\n). For abemaciclib, simulations suggested that 150\u00a0mg b.i.d. and 300\u00a0mg q.d. dosing resulted in comparable unbound brain exposure in terms of the maximum, trough, or average steady\u2010state brain concentrations of unbound abemaciclib (Table\n\n3\n).\nDrug\u2010specific parameters\n        \n          \nIn vitro metabolic kinetics\n          The overall metabolic kinetics of ribociclib, palbociclib, and abemaciclib in human liver and intestinal microsomes were well\u2010described by Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics (Figure\n\nS1\n). The estimated in vitro metabolic kinetic parameters, including the maximum metabolic velocity (Vmax), substrate concentration at which 50% of Vmax is obtained (K\nm), and in vitro intrinsic metabolic clearance (CLint) estimated as Vmax/K\nm, are summarized in Table\n\n1\n and were used for predicting the whole\u2010organ liver and intestine metabolic clearance in the PBPK models.\n        \n        \n          Binding to patient plasma proteins and brain tumor tissues\n          In the plasma of patients with cancer, ribociclib and palbociclib were bound to plasma proteins to a similar extent, with the mean fraction unbound in plasma (f\nu,p) 0.125 and 0.126, respectively, whereas abemaciclib had higher plasma binding (mean f\nu,p, 0.06). Similarly, abemaciclib showed the highest binding to human brain tumor tissues with the mean fraction unbound in brain tissue (f\nu,br) 0.006, followed by palbociclib (mean f\nu,br, 0.015) and ribociclib (mean f\nu,br, 0.044).\n        \n        \n          Passive transcellular permeability\n          The three CDK4/6 inhibitors exhibited similar apical\u2010to\u2010basolateral apparent transcellular passive permeability (P\napp,A\u2010B) across MDCKII cell monolayers at pH 7.4 in both apical and basolateral chambers (Table\n\n2\n). Based on pH partition theory (Henderson\u2013Hasselbalch equation), the unionization efficiency (\u03bb) at pH 7.4 for ribociclib (PKa, 8.87), palbociclib (PKa, 8.86), and abemaciclib (PKa, 7.94) was estimated to be 0.033, 0.034, and 0.224, respectively. Because only unbound and unionized drugs pass through biological membranes, the intrinsic passive transcellular permeability (P\napp,A\u2010B/\u03bb) for unionized drugs were estimated (Table\n\n2\n), and were then scaled to the human brain microvasculature surface area to predict the BBB passive permeability clearance (PSB) of the unbound and unionized drug in the PBPK model (Table\n\n1\n).\n          \n            Table 2\n            \n              Transcellular permeability and efflux ratios of the three CDK4/6 inhibitors, determined from the parental MDCKII, MDCKII\u2010ABCB1, and MDCKII\u2010ABCG2 cell monolayers\n            \n            \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                  Ribociclib\n                  Palbociclib\n                  Abemaciclib\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  Parental MDCKII\n                \n                \n                  Apparent permeability (P\napp,A\u2010B) (\u00d710\u22126\u00a0cm/s)\na\n\n\n                  7.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.85\n                  9.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.16\n                  9.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.21\n                \n                \n                  Net efflux ratio\nb\n\n\n                  1.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.21\n                  1.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17\n                  1.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.30\n                \n                \n                  Unionization efficiency (\u03bb)\nc\n\n\n                  0.033\n                  0.034\n                  0.224\n                \n                \n                  Intrinsic permeability (P\napp,A\u2010B/\u03bb)\nd\n\n\n                  218.6\n                  280.0\n                  40.6\n                \n                \n                  MDCKII\u2010ABCB1\n                \n                \n                  Apparent permeability (P\napp,A\u2010B) (\u00d710\u22126\u00a0cm/s)\na\n\n\n                  1.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.82\n                  5.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.10\n                  5.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.86\n                \n                \n                  Net efflux ratio\nb\n\n\n                  10.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.30\n                  5.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.04\n                  2.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.49\n                \n                \n                  MDCKII\u2010ABCG2\n                \n                \n                  Apparent permeability P\napp,A\u2010B (\u00d710\u22126\u00a0cm/s)\na\n\n\n                  5.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.91\n                  7.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25\n                  7.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.42\n                \n                \n                  Net efflux ratio\nb\n\n\n                  1.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.20\n                  2.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.05\n                  1.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                Data are expressed as the mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD from at least three independent experiments (with duplicates in each experiment).\n              \n              \n                \n                  a\n                \n                Bidirectional permeability experiments were performed at pH 7.4 in both apical and basolateral chambers.\n              \n              \n                \n                  b\n                \n                Net efflux ratio was the efflux ratio in the absence of an ABCB1 inhibitor (elacridar) or ABCG2 inhibitor (Ko145) divided by the efflux ratio in the presence of the inhibitor.\n              \n              \n                \n                  c\n                \n                Unionization efficiency (\u03bb) is the ratio of unionized form to total drug (the sum of unionized and ionized forms), where the unionized\u2010to\u2010ionized ratio is calculated based on Henderson\u2010Hasselbalch equation: Log10baseor unionizedacidionized=pH\u2010PKa.\n              \n              \n                \n                  d\n                \n                Intrinsic permeability is the transcellular permeability of the unbound and unionized drug, estimated as the mean P\napp,A\u2010B normalized by \u03bb.\n              \n            \n            \n              John Wiley & Sons, Ltd\n            \n          \n          The three CDK4/6 inhibitors are weak base drugs. Similar to AZD1775 (a weak base drug),\n19\n the three CDK4/6 inhibitors exhibited pH\u2010dependent apparent permeability across the MDCKII, MDCKII\u2010ABCB1, and MDCKII\u2010ABCG2 cell monolayers (Figure\n\n2\n). As the pH decreased (7.4, 7.0, 6.5, and 6.0) in the basolateral chamber (mimicking brain/brain tumor interstitium) whereas remaining the same (7.4) in the apical chamber (mimicking blood circulation), the apparent permeability increased in the apical\u2010to\u2010basolateral direction while decreasing in the basolateral\u2010to\u2010apical direction, overall resulting in reduced efflux ratios (Figure\n\n2\n). This observation was in accordance with the pH partition theory. At a relatively acidic basolateral pH, the ionization of a weak base drug was increased, and, as a result, the basolateral\u2010to\u2010apical permeability decreased and apical\u2010to\u2010basolateral permeability increased, thus leading to the trap of ionized drugs in the basolateral compartment.\n          \n            Figure 2\n            \n              The pH\u2010dependent apparent permeability of the three cyclin D\u2010cyclin dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors across the MDCKII, MDCKII\u2010ABCB1, and MDCKII\u2010ABCG2 cell monolayers. Bi\u2010directional permeability experiments were performed at a fixed apical pH (7.4) and varying basolateral pH (7.4, 7.0, 6.5, and 6.0). The apparent permeability in the apical\u2010to\u2010basolateral (P\napp,A\u2010B) and basolateral\u2010to\u2010apical (P\napp,B\u2010A) directions and efflux ratio (ER) are expressed as the mean fold change relative to those determined in the control (at pH 7.4 in both apical and basolateral chambers).\n            \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          ABCB1\u2010mediated and ABCG2\u2010mediated intrinsic efflux clearance\n          MDCKII cells with stable expression of ABCB1 or ABCG2 were used to determine the interactions of CDK4/6 inhibitors with ABCB1 and ABCG2, two major efflux transporters that are expressed at the human BBB. The positive controls, loperamide (a typical ABCB1 substrate) and gefitinib (a typical ABCG2 substrate) exhibited a mean net efflux ratio of 6.11 and 8.86 on MDCKII\u2010ABCB1 and MDCKII\u2010ABCG2 cell monolayers, respectively, confirming the functional expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2 in these cellular models. All three CDK4/6 inhibitors were ABCB1 substrates, whereas ABCB1 efflux efficiency appeared the highest for ribociclib (net efflux ratio 10.5), followed by palbociclib (net efflux ratio 5.92) and abemaciclib (net efflux ratio 2.84; Table\n\n2\n). Palbociclib was a substrate of ABCG2 (net efflux ratio 2.64), but ribociclib and abemaciclib were not good substrates for ABCG2 (net efflux ratio 1.02 and 1.21, respectively; Table\n\n2\n). Based on the intrinsic transcellular passive permeability and net efflux ratio, in vitro ABCB1\u2010mediated intrinsic efflux clearance was determined to be 4,354, 5,232, and 160\u00a0\u00b5L/min/mg for ribociclib, palbociclib, and abemaciclib, respectively, and the respective in vitro ABCG2 intrinsic efflux clearance was 0, 1,716, and 18\u00a0\u00b5L/min/mg (Table\n\n1\n). These values were then scaled by IVIVE strategy to predict in vivo ABCB1\u2010mediated and ABCG2\u2010mediated efflux clearance at the BBB.\n        \n        \n          \nIn vivo\u2010in vitro relative activity factor of ABCB1 and ABCG2\n          Quantitative proteomics analyses of 30 human normal brain and 47 glioblastoma samples suggest that the median protein abundances of ABCB1 and ABCG2 are 3.38 and 6.21\u00a0pmol/mg in human normal brain microvessels, respectively; and their respective levels are reduced to 0.14 and 1.69\u00a0pmol/mg in human glioblastoma microvessels.\n20\n In the cell membranes of MDCKII\u2010ABCB1 and MDCKII\u2010ABCG2 cell lines, ABCB1 and ABCG2 protein abundances are 10.3 and 13.2\u00a0pmol/mg, respectively.\n20\n The mean recovery of microvessels isolated from human normal brain and glioblastoma is 0.19 and 0.31\u00a0mg per gram tissue, respectively.\n20\n Based on these data and given an average brain weight of 1,400\u00a0g, the relative activity factor (RAF) for ABCB1 and ABCG2 was determined to be 87.3 and 125.1\u00a0mg at the intact human BBB, respectively, whereas being 5.88 and 55.5\u00a0mg at the BBB in glioblastoma.\n          ABCB1 has been located at the apical (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) facing) membrane of the blood\u2010cranial CSF barrier, and therefore ABCB1\u2010mediated active influx from the blood to cranial CSF was considered at the blood\u2010cranial CSF barrier. However, ABCB1 protein abundance data at this barrier is not available, and thus the RAF for ABCB1\u2010mediated active influx clearance at the blood\u2010CSF barrier was assigned and verified by the observed clinical CSF data of ribociclib.\nBinding to patient plasma proteins and brain tumor tissues\n          In the plasma of patients with cancer, ribociclib and palbociclib were bound to plasma proteins to a similar extent, with the mean fraction unbound in plasma (f\nu,p) 0.125 and 0.126, respectively, whereas abemaciclib had higher plasma binding (mean f\nu,p, 0.06). Similarly, abemaciclib showed the highest binding to human brain tumor tissues with the mean fraction unbound in brain tissue (f\nu,br) 0.006, followed by palbociclib (mean f\nu,br, 0.015) and ribociclib (mean f\nu,br, 0.044).\nPassive transcellular permeability\n          The three CDK4/6 inhibitors exhibited similar apical\u2010to\u2010basolateral apparent transcellular passive permeability (P\napp,A\u2010B) across MDCKII cell monolayers at pH 7.4 in both apical and basolateral chambers (Table\n\n2\n). Based on pH partition theory (Henderson\u2013Hasselbalch equation), the unionization efficiency (\u03bb) at pH 7.4 for ribociclib (PKa, 8.87), palbociclib (PKa, 8.86), and abemaciclib (PKa, 7.94) was estimated to be 0.033, 0.034, and 0.224, respectively. Because only unbound and unionized drugs pass through biological membranes, the intrinsic passive transcellular permeability (P\napp,A\u2010B/\u03bb) for unionized drugs were estimated (Table\n\n2\n), and were then scaled to the human brain microvasculature surface area to predict the BBB passive permeability clearance (PSB) of the unbound and unionized drug in the PBPK model (Table\n\n1\n).\n          \n            Table 2\n            \n              Transcellular permeability and efflux ratios of the three CDK4/6 inhibitors, determined from the parental MDCKII, MDCKII\u2010ABCB1, and MDCKII\u2010ABCG2 cell monolayers\n            \n            \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                  Ribociclib\n                  Palbociclib\n                  Abemaciclib\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  Parental MDCKII\n                \n                \n                  Apparent permeability (P\napp,A\u2010B) (\u00d710\u22126\u00a0cm/s)\na\n\n\n                  7.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.85\n                  9.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.16\n                  9.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.21\n                \n                \n                  Net efflux ratio\nb\n\n\n                  1.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.21\n                  1.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17\n                  1.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.30\n                \n                \n                  Unionization efficiency (\u03bb)\nc\n\n\n                  0.033\n                  0.034\n                  0.224\n                \n                \n                  Intrinsic permeability (P\napp,A\u2010B/\u03bb)\nd\n\n\n                  218.6\n                  280.0\n                  40.6\n                \n                \n                  MDCKII\u2010ABCB1\n                \n                \n                  Apparent permeability (P\napp,A\u2010B) (\u00d710\u22126\u00a0cm/s)\na\n\n\n                  1.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.82\n                  5.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.10\n                  5.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.86\n                \n                \n                  Net efflux ratio\nb\n\n\n                  10.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.30\n                  5.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.04\n                  2.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.49\n                \n                \n                  MDCKII\u2010ABCG2\n                \n                \n                  Apparent permeability P\napp,A\u2010B (\u00d710\u22126\u00a0cm/s)\na\n\n\n                  5.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.91\n                  7.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25\n                  7.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.42\n                \n                \n                  Net efflux ratio\nb\n\n\n                  1.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.20\n                  2.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.05\n                  1.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                Data are expressed as the mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD from at least three independent experiments (with duplicates in each experiment).\n              \n              \n                \n                  a\n                \n                Bidirectional permeability experiments were performed at pH 7.4 in both apical and basolateral chambers.\n              \n              \n                \n                  b\n                \n                Net efflux ratio was the efflux ratio in the absence of an ABCB1 inhibitor (elacridar) or ABCG2 inhibitor (Ko145) divided by the efflux ratio in the presence of the inhibitor.\n              \n              \n                \n                  c\n                \n                Unionization efficiency (\u03bb) is the ratio of unionized form to total drug (the sum of unionized and ionized forms), where the unionized\u2010to\u2010ionized ratio is calculated based on Henderson\u2010Hasselbalch equation: Log10baseor unionizedacidionized=pH\u2010PKa.\n              \n              \n                \n                  d\n                \n                Intrinsic permeability is the transcellular permeability of the unbound and unionized drug, estimated as the mean P\napp,A\u2010B normalized by \u03bb.\n              \n            \n            \n              John Wiley & Sons, Ltd\n            \n          \n          The three CDK4/6 inhibitors are weak base drugs. Similar to AZD1775 (a weak base drug),\n19\n the three CDK4/6 inhibitors exhibited pH\u2010dependent apparent permeability across the MDCKII, MDCKII\u2010ABCB1, and MDCKII\u2010ABCG2 cell monolayers (Figure\n\n2\n). As the pH decreased (7.4, 7.0, 6.5, and 6.0) in the basolateral chamber (mimicking brain/brain tumor interstitium) whereas remaining the same (7.4) in the apical chamber (mimicking blood circulation), the apparent permeability increased in the apical\u2010to\u2010basolateral direction while decreasing in the basolateral\u2010to\u2010apical direction, overall resulting in reduced efflux ratios (Figure\n\n2\n). This observation was in accordance with the pH partition theory. At a relatively acidic basolateral pH, the ionization of a weak base drug was increased, and, as a result, the basolateral\u2010to\u2010apical permeability decreased and apical\u2010to\u2010basolateral permeability increased, thus leading to the trap of ionized drugs in the basolateral compartment.\n          \n            Figure 2\n            \n              The pH\u2010dependent apparent permeability of the three cyclin D\u2010cyclin dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors across the MDCKII, MDCKII\u2010ABCB1, and MDCKII\u2010ABCG2 cell monolayers. Bi\u2010directional permeability experiments were performed at a fixed apical pH (7.4) and varying basolateral pH (7.4, 7.0, 6.5, and 6.0). The apparent permeability in the apical\u2010to\u2010basolateral (P\napp,A\u2010B) and basolateral\u2010to\u2010apical (P\napp,B\u2010A) directions and efflux ratio (ER) are expressed as the mean fold change relative to those determined in the control (at pH 7.4 in both apical and basolateral chambers).\nABCB1\u2010mediated and ABCG2\u2010mediated intrinsic efflux clearance\n          MDCKII cells with stable expression of ABCB1 or ABCG2 were used to determine the interactions of CDK4/6 inhibitors with ABCB1 and ABCG2, two major efflux transporters that are expressed at the human BBB. The positive controls, loperamide (a typical ABCB1 substrate) and gefitinib (a typical ABCG2 substrate) exhibited a mean net efflux ratio of 6.11 and 8.86 on MDCKII\u2010ABCB1 and MDCKII\u2010ABCG2 cell monolayers, respectively, confirming the functional expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2 in these cellular models. All three CDK4/6 inhibitors were ABCB1 substrates, whereas ABCB1 efflux efficiency appeared the highest for ribociclib (net efflux ratio 10.5), followed by palbociclib (net efflux ratio 5.92) and abemaciclib (net efflux ratio 2.84; Table\n\n2\n). Palbociclib was a substrate of ABCG2 (net efflux ratio 2.64), but ribociclib and abemaciclib were not good substrates for ABCG2 (net efflux ratio 1.02 and 1.21, respectively; Table\n\n2\n). Based on the intrinsic transcellular passive permeability and net efflux ratio, in vitro ABCB1\u2010mediated intrinsic efflux clearance was determined to be 4,354, 5,232, and 160\u00a0\u00b5L/min/mg for ribociclib, palbociclib, and abemaciclib, respectively, and the respective in vitro ABCG2 intrinsic efflux clearance was 0, 1,716, and 18\u00a0\u00b5L/min/mg (Table\n\n1\n). These values were then scaled by IVIVE strategy to predict in vivo ABCB1\u2010mediated and ABCG2\u2010mediated efflux clearance at the BBB.\nPBPK modeling and simulations\n        \n          Model verification for prediction of plasma pharmacokinetics\n          Following the dosing regimen (900\u00a0mg q.d. for 5\u00a0days) as used in the clinical trial, the PBPK model well\u2010predicted ribociclib mean plasma concentration time profiles and interindividual variabilities, as demonstrated by >\u00a098% of observed plasma concentration data falling within the 5th and 95th percentiles of the simulated population mean profile (Figure\n\n3\n\na). The model\u2010simulated population mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of ribociclib were 1.03\u2010fold and 0.90\u2010fold of the respective observed parameters (i.e., predicted vs. observed Cmax, 3.87 vs. 3.75\u00a0\u00b5mol/L; CL/F, 55.5 vs. 61.6\u00a0L/h).\n12\n\n\n          \n            Figure 3\n            \n              Physiologically\u2010based pharmacokinetic model\u2010simulated and clinically observed plasma and central nervous system (CNS) pharmacokinetics of ribociclib.

(f) Simulated unbound ribociclib concentration\u2010time profiles in brain tumors with pH 6.5 and loss of ABCB1 expression at the BBB. Simulations of 10 trials with 10 subjects in each were performed in the Simcyp virtual cancer patient population following 5\u2010day ribociclib treatment at a daily oral dose of 900\u00a0mg. Observed clinical plasma and CNS pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 12 glioblastoma patients treated with ribociclib (900\u00a0mg q.d. for 5\u00a0days).\n            \n            \n          \n          Similarly, the developed PBPK models well\u2010predicted the plasma pharmacokinetics of palbociclib and abemaciclib. The simulated population mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters were within 0.90\u20131.15\u2010fold of the respective parameters estimated by population pharmacokinetic modeling analysis of observed data in patients with cancer.\n21\n, \n22\n Specifically, the predicted vs. observed palbociclib CL/F was 59.4 vs. 63.1\u00a0L/hour, elimination half\u2010life (T\n1/2) was 30 vs. 29\u00a0hours, apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was 2,283 vs. 2,342\u00a0L, and oral bioavailability (F) was 0.47 vs. 0.46. The predicted vs. observed abemaciclib CL/F was 35.9 vs. 36.0\u00a0L/hour, T\n1/2 was 22 vs. 20\u00a0hours, V/F was 1,041 vs. 1,050\u00a0L, and F was 0.52 vs. 0.45.\n        \n        \n          Model verification for prediction of CNS pharmacokinetics\n          Given the availability of ribociclib CNS pharmacokinetic data (i.e., CSF and tumor concentrations) observed in patients with glioblastoma,\n12\n the 4Brain model was first developed and verified for the prediction of CNS pharmacokinetics of ribociclib. The simulated ribociclib CSF concentrations were in line with observed CSF data in patients with glioblastoma, with all except for one observed data falling within the 5th and 95th percentiles of the simulated population mean profile (Figure\n\n3\n\nb). The model\u2010predicted population mean CSF\u2010to\u2010unbound plasma ratio (CSF Kp,uu, 1.6) was 0.9\u2010fold of the observed median CSF K\np,uu (1.8) in 12 patients with glioblastoma.\n12\n\n\n          The physical and biochemical barriers of the BBB in glioblastomas are often disrupted, as indicated by leaky tight junctions and loss or significant reduction in protein expression of major BBB efflux transporters.\n20\n It has been reported that the median protein abundances of ABCB1 and ABCG2 in glioblastoma microvessels are reduced to 3.7% and 35% of the normal levels, respectively.\n20\n In addition, electrode measurements of pH in human brain tumors are as low as 5.9 with a mean around 6.8; whereas, normal human brain maintains a pH at ~\u00a07.1\u20137.2.\n23\n, \n24\n, \n25\n As demonstrated by the in vitro pH\u2010dependent apparent permeability data (Figure\n\n2\n), the relative acidic tumor environment would be favorable to the tumor penetration and trap of weak base drugs, regardless whether they are the substrates of ABCB1/ABCG2. The regional pH difference in the normal brain and brain tumors may contribute to the heterogeneous brain/tumor distribution of CDK4/6 inhibitors. Therefore, to predict ribociclib concentrations in the human normal brain as well as in contrast non\u2010enhancing and enhancing tumor regions of glioblastoma, different ABCB1/ABCG2 protein abundances at the BBB and varying brain pH were applied in the simulations following the dosing regimen used in the clinical trial (900\u00a0mg q.d. for 5\u00a0days; Figure\n\n3\n\nc\u2010f). In the normal brain with an intact BBB (i.e., brain pH 7.12, ABCB1 abundance 3.38\u00a0pmol/mg), the simulated population mean steady\u2010state average concentration (C\nss,ave) of unbound ribociclib was 0.036\u00a0\u00b5mol/L and unbound brain\u2010to\u2010plasma ratio (K\np,uu) was 0.14 (Figure\n\n3\n\nc). In brain tumors with increasing BBB disruption, specifically in brain tumors with (i) pH 6.8 and ABCB1 abundance 0.14\u00a0pmol/mg (Figure\n\n3\n\nd), (ii) pH 6.8 and loss of ABCB1 expression (Figure\n\n3\n\ne), and (iii) pH 6.5 and loss of ABCB1 expression (Figure\n\n3\n\nf), the simulated population mean C\nss,ave of unbound ribociclib was 0.453, 2.608, 5.096\u00a0\u00b5mol/L, respectively, and the respective K\np,uu was 1.84, 10.6, and 20.8. Notably, the predicted ribociclib tumor concentrations and extent of tumor penetration (K\np,uu) were in accordance with the observed data in non\u2010enhancing and enhancing tumor regions in patients with glioblastoma, showing the observed median (range) unbound ribociclib tumor concentrations of 0.458 (0.015\u20131.295) \u00b5mol/L and 1.644 (0.307\u20134.743) \u00b5mol/L, respectively, and the observed K\np,uu of 1.8 (0.7\u201311.3) and 10.1 (2.4\u201337.4), respectively.\n12\n Collectively, these data suggested that the developed 4Brain model well\u2010predicted the CNS pharmacokinetics of ribociclib as observed in patients with glioblastoma. Therefore, the system\u2010specific parameters for the 4Brain model (e.g., the transporter RAFs at the BBB and blood\u2010CSF barrier) were verified, and could be confidently applied to predict the CNS pharmacokinetics of palbociclib and abemaciclib (for which no or limited clinical CNS data were available).\n          The model\u2010simulated steady\u2010state concentrations of unbound abemaciclib and palbociclib in the human normal brain and CSF are summarized in Table\n\n3\n. For abemaciclib, limited CSF data were obtained from 10 patients following varying dosing regimens (i.e., daily or twice daily oral dosing at 50\u2013275\u00a0mg for 15\u00a0days).\n14\n A direct comparison between the observed and predicted abemaciclib CSF data was not feasible because of varying dosing regimens and varying sampling times in the reported clinical study. Nevertheless, the observed abemaciclib CSF concentrations (range, 0.004\u20130.030\u00a0\u00b5mol/L) generally overlapped with the predicted data (population mean C\nss,ave, 0.038\u00a0\u00b5mol/L; 5th and 95th percentiles, 0.013\u20130.091\u00a0\u00b5mol/L) following the standard dosing regimen (150\u00a0mg b.i.d. for 28\u00a0days). In addition, the predicted mean CSF K\np,uu was 1.10\u2010fold of the observed data (predicted vs. observed mean, 0.77 vs. 0.70).\n          \n            Table 3\n            \n              PBPK

Preclinical studies showed that the brain penetration of palbociclib (K\np,uu, 0.01 in rats and mice) was ~\u00a010\u2010fold less than that of abemaciclib (K\np,uu, 0.11 in rats and 0.17 in mice).\n15\n Despite the species difference in the absolute K\np,uu values between humans and rodents, the model\u2010predicted 10\u2010fold less brain penetration of palbociclib than abemaciclib in humans (K\np,uu, 0.12 vs. 1.04) was consistent with preclinical observation. The brain penetration of ABCB1 substrates is expected to be larger in humans than rodents because ABCB1 protein abundance is significantly lower at the human BBB than rodent BBB and also because of species difference in the CSF dynamics and brain physiology.\n20\n, \n26\n For example, the brain penetration (K\np,uu) of ABCB1 substrate drugs (including verapamil, GR205171, altanserin, and AZD1775) has been reported to be several to over 10\u2010fold greater in humans than in rodents.\n19\n, \n27\n, \n28\n\n\n        \n        \n          Comparison of the CNS pharmacokinetics among the three CDK4/6 inhibitors\n          Ribocliclib and palbociclib are similar with respect to the chemical structure, physicochemical properties, binding to plasma proteins and brain tissues, as well as intrinsic passive transcellular permeability and intrinsic active efflux clearance; whereas abemaciclib is significantly dissimilar than either one (Table\n\n1\n and Table\n\n2\n). Therefore, it was not surprising that the CNS pharmacokinetics of abemaciclib was different from the other two CDK4/6 inhibitors, which was characterized by a slower brain penetration but to a larger extent (Figure\n\n4\n\na\u2010c). It is known that the rate of drug brain penetration is largely driven by the drug binding to brain tissue and passive or active efflux clearance at the BBB. Specifically, higher brain tissue binding and lower passive or active efflux clearance at the BBB lead to slower brain penetration.\n19\n Hence, the slower brain penetration of abemaciclib was expected given its significantly higher brain tissue binding and lower passive and active efflux clearance at the BBB as compared with ribociclib and palbociclib.\n          \n            Figure 4\n            \n              Physiologically\u2010based pharmacokinetic model\u2010simulated plasma and central nervous system pharmacokinetics of the three cyclin D\u2010cyclin dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors following varying dosing regimens. (a) Simulated population mean plasma, CSF, and brain concentration time profiles of unbound ribociclib following a single oral dose (600\u00a0mg). (b) Simulated population mean plasma, CSF, and brain concentration time profiles of unbound palbociclib following a single oral dose (125\u00a0mg). (c) Simulated population mean plasma, CSF, and brain concentration time profiles of unbound abemaciclib following a single oral dose (150\u00a0mg). (d, e) Simulated unbound ribociclib brain concentration time profiles following the standard dosing regimen (600\u00a0mg q.d. for 3\u2010weeks) and modified dosing regimen (900\u00a0mg q.d. for 3\u00a0weeks). (f, g) Simulated unbound palbociclib brain concentration time profiles following the standard dosing regimen (125\u00a0mg q.d. for 3\u2010weeks) and modified dosing regimen (187\u00a0mg q.d. for 3\u00a0weeks). (h, i) Simulated unbound abemaciclib brain concentration time profiles following the standard dosing regimen (150\u00a0mg b.i.d. for 4\u2010weeks) and modified dosing regimen (300\u00a0mg q.d. for 4\u00a0weeks). Simulations of 10 trials with 10 subjects in each trial were performed in the Simcyp virtual cancer patient population.\n            \n            \n          \n          Despite slow brain penetration, abemaciclib penetrated into the brain to a larger extent than the other two CDK4/6 inhibitors. The PBPK models predicted that ribociclib and palbociclib shared a similar brain K\np,uu (~\u00a00.14 vs. 0.12), whereas abemaciclib had a K\np,uu of ~\u00a01.0 (Table\n\n3\n). It is known that the K\np,uu (the extent of brain penetration) is determined by the relative contribution of passive clearance and transporter\u2010mediated active clearance at the BBB.\n29\n If the BBB transport of a drug is dominated by passive permeability, the K\np,uu would approach 1; whereas when a drug is actively transported by efflux or uptake transporters at the BBB, the K\np,uu would be smaller or larger than 1.0. Although the three CDK4/6 inhibitors were ABCB1 substrates, abemaciclib showed ~\u00a030\u2010fold lower ABCB1\u2010mediated intrinsic efflux clearance as compared with ribociclib and palbociclib (Table\n\n1\n). In addition, although palbociclib and abemaciclib were identified as the substrates for mouse abcg2,\n15\n our study suggested that palbociclib was a substrate of human ABCG2, but ribociclib and abemaciclib were not, at least not good substrates for human ABCG2 (Table\n\n2\n). ABCB1 and ABCG2 are two predominant efflux transporters at the human BBB, acting synergistically to restrict the brain penetration of dual ABCB1/ABCG2 substrates.\n30\n, \n31\n, \n32\n Palbociclib was a dual substrate for ABCB1 and ABCG2, whereas ribociclib and abemaciclib appeared to be transported mainly by ABCB1. Collectively, the IVIVE predicted that the overall efflux transporter\u2010mediated in vivo efflux clearance at the human BBB was 1.0\u00a0L/hour for abemaciclib, 22.8\u00a0L/hour for ribociclib, and 40.3\u00a0L/hour for palbociclib, which accounted for 0.2\u2010fold, 6.4\u2010fold, and 4.9\u2010fold of their respective BBB passive clearance at a normal brain pH. These data suggested that the BBB transport of abemaciclib was dominated by passive permeability, whereas the BBB transport of ribociclib and palbociclib was dominated by active efflux.\n          Also noted was that the CSF pharmacokinetics of abemaciclib was different from the other two CDK4/6 inhibitors (Figure\n\n4\n\na\u2010c). The predicted mean CSF\u2010to\u2010unbound plasma ratio of abemaciclib (CSF K\np,uu, 0.8) was close to its brain K\np,uu (1.0), indicating that abemaciclib CSF concentration could be used as a surrogate for unbound brain concentration. By contrary, the predicted CSF K\np,uu of ribociclib (~\u00a01.6) and palbociclib (~\u00a01.8) was >\u00a010\u2010fold of their respective brain K\np,uu, consistent with the predicted ~\u00a010\u2010fold higher CSF concentrations than their respective unbound brain concentrations (Table\n\n3\n). Drug penetration from the circulation blood to CSF is controlled by the blood\u2010CSF barrier, which is formed by the choroid plexus epithelial cells and the arachnoid membrane.\n33\n ABCB1 expression has been identified on the apical, CSF\u2010facing side of the blood\u2010CSF barrier, suggesting that ABCB1 facilitates the transport of substrates into the CSF.\n34\n, \n35\n Therefore, the dominant ABCB1\u2010mediated active CSF uptake of ribociclib and palbociclib at the blood\u2010CSF barrier resulted in CSF K\np,uu\u00a0>\u00a01.0. By contrary, ABCB1 played a minor role in the BBB or CSF penetration of abemaciclib because of the insignificant ABCB1 intrinsic clearance of abemaciclib. The PBPK model predictions supported the notion that CSF concentrations may be useful as a reflection of unbound drug brain concentrations for drugs (e.g., abemaciclib) that pass the BBB and blood\u2010CSF barrier mainly by passive transcellular permeability, whereas for drugs (e.g., ribociclib and palbociclib) that undergo dominant active transport at the BBB and blood\u2010CSF barrier, the relationship between unbound drug brain and CSF concentrations may not be obvious.\n36\n\n\n        \n        \n          Refining dosing regimens\n          Target engagement ratio, defined as the ratio of the average steady\u2010state unbound drug brain concentration to the in vitro IC50 for CDK4/6 inhibition, was used as a crude predictor of efficacy.\n15\n Theoretically, a target engagement ratio \u2265\u00a01 would lead to 50% or greater inhibition of CDK4/6. Abemaciclib is the most potent CDK4/6 inhibitor (with the in vitro IC50 of 2 and 10\u00a0nM for inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6, respectively) as compared with palbociclib (IC50, 11 and 15\u00a0nM) and ribociclib (IC50, 10 and 39\u00a0nM).\n13\n Simulations following the standard dosing regimens suggested that the predicted population mean brain C\nss,ave of unbound ribociclib, palbociclib, and abemaciclib were 0.024, 0.004, and 0.052\u00a0\u00b5mol/L, respectively, and correspondingly the CDK4/6 target engagement ratios were 2.4/0.62 for ribociclib, 0.36/0.27 for palbociclib, and 26/5.2 for abemaciclib (Table\n\n3\n). Based on the criterion of target engagement ratio \u2265\u00a01 required for potential clinical efficacy, abemaciclib achieved adequate inhibition for CDK4 and CDK6 in the human brain at the standard dosing regimen (150\u00a0mg b.i.d.). However, ribociclib may sufficiently inhibit CDK4, but not CDK6 in the brain at the standard dosing regimen (600\u00a0mg q.d.). Palbociclib did not achieve adequate brain concentrations to inhibit CDK4 or CDK6 following the standard dosing regimen (125\u00a0mg q.d.).\n          Additional simulations were performed to refine dosing regimens (Figure\n\n4\n). Following 21\u2010day treatment of ribociclib at the maximum tolerated dose (900\u00a0mg q.d.), the simulated population mean brain Css,ave of unbound ribociclib was 0.036\u00a0\u00b5mol/L and the corresponding CDK4/6 target engagement ratios were 3.6/0.92 (Table\n\n3\n), indicating that the treatment of ribociclib at the maximum tolerated dose may sufficiently inhibit both CDK4 and CDK6. However, palbociclib did not achieve sufficient brain concentration for CDK4/6 inhibition (target engagement ratios <\u00a00.5) even at a dose 50% higher than the standard dose (Table\n\n3\n). For abemaciclib, simulations suggested that 150\u00a0mg b.i.d. and 300\u00a0mg q.d. dosing resulted in comparable unbound brain exposure in terms of the maximum, trough, or average steady\u2010state brain concentrations of unbound abemaciclib (Table\n\n3\n).\nModel verification for prediction of plasma pharmacokinetics\n          Following the dosing regimen (900\u00a0mg q.d. for 5\u00a0days) as used in the clinical trial, the PBPK model well\u2010predicted ribociclib mean plasma concentration time profiles and interindividual variabilities, as demonstrated by >\u00a098% of observed plasma concentration data falling within the 5th and 95th percentiles of the simulated population mean profile (Figure\n\n3\n\na). The model\u2010simulated population mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of ribociclib were 1.03\u2010fold and 0.90\u2010fold of the respective observed parameters (i.e., predicted vs. observed Cmax, 3.87 vs. 3.75\u00a0\u00b5mol/L; CL/F, 55.5 vs. 61.6\u00a0L/h).\n12\n\n\n          \n            Figure 3\n            \n              Physiologically\u2010based pharmacokinetic model\u2010simulated and clinically observed plasma and central nervous system (CNS) pharmacokinetics of ribociclib.

(c) Simulated unbound ribociclib brain concentration\u2010time profiles in the human normal brain (with brain pH 7.12 and ABCB1 abundance 3.38\u00a0pmol/mg at the BBB).

(f) Simulated unbound ribociclib concentration\u2010time profiles in brain tumors with pH 6.5 and loss of ABCB1 expression at the BBB. Simulations of 10 trials with 10 subjects in each were performed in the Simcyp virtual cancer patient population following 5\u2010day ribociclib treatment at a daily oral dose of 900\u00a0mg. Observed clinical plasma and CNS pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 12 glioblastoma patients treated with ribociclib (900\u00a0mg q.d. for 5\u00a0days).\n            \n            \n          \n          Similarly, the developed PBPK models well\u2010predicted the plasma pharmacokinetics of palbociclib and abemaciclib. The simulated population mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters were within 0.90\u20131.15\u2010fold of the respective parameters estimated by population pharmacokinetic modeling analysis of observed data in patients with cancer.\n21\n, \n22\n Specifically, the predicted vs. observed palbociclib CL/F was 59.4 vs. 63.1\u00a0L/hour, elimination half\u2010life (T\n1/2) was 30 vs. 29\u00a0hours, apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was 2,283 vs. 2,342\u00a0L, and oral bioavailability (F) was 0.47 vs. 0.46. The predicted vs. observed abemaciclib CL/F was 35.9 vs. 36.0\u00a0L/hour, T\n1/2 was 22 vs. 20\u00a0hours, V/F was 1,041 vs. 1,050\u00a0L, and F was 0.52 vs. 0.45.\nModel verification for prediction of CNS pharmacokinetics\n          Given the availability of ribociclib CNS pharmacokinetic data (i.e., CSF and tumor concentrations) observed in patients with glioblastoma,\n12\n the 4Brain model was first developed and verified for the prediction of CNS pharmacokinetics of ribociclib. The simulated ribociclib CSF concentrations were in line with observed CSF data in patients with glioblastoma, with all except for one observed data falling within the 5th and 95th percentiles of the simulated population mean profile (Figure\n\n3\n\nb). The model\u2010predicted population mean CSF\u2010to\u2010unbound plasma ratio (CSF Kp,uu, 1.6) was 0.9\u2010fold of the observed median CSF K\np,uu (1.8) in 12 patients with glioblastoma.\n12\n\n\n          The physical and biochemical barriers of the BBB in glioblastomas are often disrupted, as indicated by leaky tight junctions and loss or significant reduction in protein expression of major BBB efflux transporters.\n20\n It has been reported that the median protein abundances of ABCB1 and ABCG2 in glioblastoma microvessels are reduced to 3.7% and 35% of the normal levels, respectively.\n20\n In addition, electrode measurements of pH in human brain tumors are as low as 5.9 with a mean around 6.8; whereas, normal human brain maintains a pH at ~\u00a07.1\u20137.2.\n23\n, \n24\n, \n25\n As demonstrated by the in vitro pH\u2010dependent apparent permeability data (Figure\n\n2\n), the relative acidic tumor environment would be favorable to the tumor penetration and trap of weak base drugs, regardless whether they are the substrates of ABCB1/ABCG2. The regional pH difference in the normal brain and brain tumors may contribute to the heterogeneous brain/tumor distribution of CDK4/6 inhibitors. Therefore, to predict ribociclib concentrations in the human normal brain as well as in contrast non\u2010enhancing and enhancing tumor regions of glioblastoma, different ABCB1/ABCG2 protein abundances at the BBB and varying brain pH were applied in the simulations following the dosing regimen used in the clinical trial (900\u00a0mg q.d. for 5\u00a0days; Figure\n\n3\n\nc\u2010f). In the normal brain with an intact BBB (i.e., brain pH 7.12, ABCB1 abundance 3.38\u00a0pmol/mg), the simulated population mean steady\u2010state average concentration (C\nss,ave) of unbound ribociclib was 0.036\u00a0\u00b5mol/L and unbound brain\u2010to\u2010plasma ratio (K\np,uu) was 0.14 (Figure\n\n3\n\nc). In brain tumors with increasing BBB disruption, specifically in brain tumors with (i) pH 6.8 and ABCB1 abundance 0.14\u00a0pmol/mg (Figure\n\n3\n\nd), (ii) pH 6.8 and loss of ABCB1 expression (Figure\n\n3\n\ne), and (iii) pH 6.5 and loss of ABCB1 expression (Figure\n\n3\n\nf), the simulated population mean C\nss,ave of unbound ribociclib was 0.453, 2.608, 5.096\u00a0\u00b5mol/L, respectively, and the respective K\np,uu was 1.84, 10.6, and 20.8. Notably, the predicted ribociclib tumor concentrations and extent of tumor penetration (K\np,uu) were in accordance with the observed data in non\u2010enhancing and enhancing tumor regions in patients with glioblastoma, showing the observed median (range) unbound ribociclib tumor concentrations of 0.458 (0.015\u20131.295) \u00b5mol/L and 1.644 (0.307\u20134.743) \u00b5mol/L, respectively, and the observed K\np,uu of 1.8 (0.7\u201311.3) and 10.1 (2.4\u201337.4), respectively.\n12\n Collectively, these data suggested that the developed 4Brain model well\u2010predicted the CNS pharmacokinetics of ribociclib as observed in patients with glioblastoma. Therefore, the system\u2010specific parameters for the 4Brain model (e.g., the transporter RAFs at the BBB and blood\u2010CSF barrier) were verified, and could be confidently applied to predict the CNS pharmacokinetics of palbociclib and abemaciclib (for which no or limited clinical CNS data were available).\n          The model\u2010simulated steady\u2010state concentrations of unbound abemaciclib and palbociclib in the human normal brain and CSF are summarized in Table\n\n3\n. For abemaciclib, limited CSF data were obtained from 10 patients following varying dosing regimens (i.e., daily or twice daily oral dosing at 50\u2013275\u00a0mg for 15\u00a0days).\n14\n A direct comparison between the observed and predicted abemaciclib CSF data was not feasible because of varying dosing regimens and varying sampling times in the reported clinical study. Nevertheless, the observed abemaciclib CSF concentrations (range, 0.004\u20130.030\u00a0\u00b5mol/L) generally overlapped with the predicted data (population mean C\nss,ave, 0.038\u00a0\u00b5mol/L; 5th and 95th percentiles, 0.013\u20130.091\u00a0\u00b5mol/L) following the standard dosing regimen (150\u00a0mg b.i.d. for 28\u00a0days). In addition, the predicted mean CSF K\np,uu was 1.10\u2010fold of the observed data (predicted vs. observed mean, 0.77 vs. 0.70).\n          \n            Table 3\n            \n              PBPK

Preclinical studies showed that the brain penetration of palbociclib (K\np,uu, 0.01 in rats and mice) was ~\u00a010\u2010fold less than that of abemaciclib (K\np,uu, 0.11 in rats and 0.17 in mice).\n15\n Despite the species difference in the absolute K\np,uu values between humans and rodents, the model\u2010predicted 10\u2010fold less brain penetration of palbociclib than abemaciclib in humans (K\np,uu, 0.12 vs. 1.04) was consistent with preclinical observation. The brain penetration of ABCB1 substrates is expected to be larger in humans than rodents because ABCB1 protein abundance is significantly lower at the human BBB than rodent BBB and also because of species difference in the CSF dynamics and brain physiology.\n20\n, \n26\n For example, the brain penetration (K\np,uu) of ABCB1 substrate drugs (including verapamil, GR205171, altanserin, and AZD1775) has been reported to be several to over 10\u2010fold greater in humans than in rodents.\n19\n, \n27\n, \n28\nComparison of the CNS pharmacokinetics among the three CDK4/6 inhibitors\n          Ribocliclib and palbociclib are similar with respect to the chemical structure, physicochemical properties, binding to plasma proteins and brain tissues, as well as intrinsic passive transcellular permeability and intrinsic active efflux clearance; whereas abemaciclib is significantly dissimilar than either one (Table\n\n1\n and Table\n\n2\n). Therefore, it was not surprising that the CNS pharmacokinetics of abemaciclib was different from the other two CDK4/6 inhibitors, which was characterized by a slower brain penetration but to a larger extent (Figure\n\n4\n\na\u2010c). It is known that the rate of drug brain penetration is largely driven by the drug binding to brain tissue and passive or active efflux clearance at the BBB. Specifically, higher brain tissue binding and lower passive or active efflux clearance at the BBB lead to slower brain penetration.\n19\n Hence, the slower brain penetration of abemaciclib was expected given its significantly higher brain tissue binding and lower passive and active efflux clearance at the BBB as compared with ribociclib and palbociclib.\n          \n            Figure 4\n            \n              Physiologically\u2010based pharmacokinetic model\u2010simulated plasma and central nervous system pharmacokinetics of the three cyclin D\u2010cyclin dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors following varying dosing regimens.

(b) Simulated population mean plasma, CSF, and brain concentration time profiles of unbound palbociclib following a single oral dose (125\u00a0mg). (c) Simulated population mean plasma, CSF, and brain concentration time profiles of unbound abemaciclib following a single oral dose (150\u00a0mg). (d, e) Simulated unbound ribociclib brain concentration time profiles following the standard dosing regimen (600\u00a0mg q.d. for 3\u2010weeks) and modified dosing regimen (900\u00a0mg q.d. for 3\u00a0weeks). (f, g) Simulated unbound palbociclib brain concentration time profiles following the standard dosing regimen (125\u00a0mg q.d. for 3\u2010weeks) and modified dosing regimen (187\u00a0mg q.d. for 3\u00a0weeks). (h, i) Simulated unbound abemaciclib brain concentration time profiles following the standard dosing regimen (150\u00a0mg b.i.d. for 4\u2010weeks) and modified dosing regimen (300\u00a0mg q.d. for 4\u00a0weeks). Simulations of 10 trials with 10 subjects in each trial were performed in the Simcyp virtual cancer patient population.\n            \n            \n          \n          Despite slow brain penetration, abemaciclib penetrated into the brain to a larger extent than the other two CDK4/6 inhibitors. The PBPK models predicted that ribociclib and palbociclib shared a similar brain K\np,uu (~\u00a00.14 vs. 0.12), whereas abemaciclib had a K\np,uu of ~\u00a01.0 (Table\n\n3\n). It is known that the K\np,uu (the extent of brain penetration) is determined by the relative contribution of passive clearance and transporter\u2010mediated active clearance at the BBB.\n29\n If the BBB transport of a drug is dominated by passive permeability, the K\np,uu would approach 1; whereas when a drug is actively transported by efflux or uptake transporters at the BBB, the K\np,uu would be smaller or larger than 1.0. Although the three CDK4/6 inhibitors were ABCB1 substrates, abemaciclib showed ~\u00a030\u2010fold lower ABCB1\u2010mediated intrinsic efflux clearance as compared with ribociclib and palbociclib (Table\n\n1\n). In addition, although palbociclib and abemaciclib were identified as the substrates for mouse abcg2,\n15\n our study suggested that palbociclib was a substrate of human ABCG2, but ribociclib and abemaciclib were not, at least not good substrates for human ABCG2 (Table\n\n2\n). ABCB1 and ABCG2 are two predominant efflux transporters at the human BBB, acting synergistically to restrict the brain penetration of dual ABCB1/ABCG2 substrates.\n30\n, \n31\n, \n32\n Palbociclib was a dual substrate for ABCB1 and ABCG2, whereas ribociclib and abemaciclib appeared to be transported mainly by ABCB1. Collectively, the IVIVE predicted that the overall efflux transporter\u2010mediated in vivo efflux clearance at the human BBB was 1.0\u00a0L/hour for abemaciclib, 22.8\u00a0L/hour for ribociclib, and 40.3\u00a0L/hour for palbociclib, which accounted for 0.2\u2010fold, 6.4\u2010fold, and 4.9\u2010fold of their respective BBB passive clearance at a normal brain pH. These data suggested that the BBB transport of abemaciclib was dominated by passive permeability, whereas the BBB transport of ribociclib and palbociclib was dominated by active efflux.\n          Also noted was that the CSF pharmacokinetics of abemaciclib was different from the other two CDK4/6 inhibitors (Figure\n\n4\n\na\u2010c). The predicted mean CSF\u2010to\u2010unbound plasma ratio of abemaciclib (CSF K\np,uu, 0.8) was close to its brain K\np,uu (1.0), indicating that abemaciclib CSF concentration could be used as a surrogate for unbound brain concentration. By contrary, the predicted CSF K\np,uu of ribociclib (~\u00a01.6) and palbociclib (~\u00a01.8) was >\u00a010\u2010fold of their respective brain K\np,uu, consistent with the predicted ~\u00a010\u2010fold higher CSF concentrations than their respective unbound brain concentrations (Table\n\n3\n). Drug penetration from the circulation blood to CSF is controlled by the blood\u2010CSF barrier, which is formed by the choroid plexus epithelial cells and the arachnoid membrane.\n33\n ABCB1 expression has been identified on the apical, CSF\u2010facing side of the blood\u2010CSF barrier, suggesting that ABCB1 facilitates the transport of substrates into the CSF.\n34\n, \n35\n Therefore, the dominant ABCB1\u2010mediated active CSF uptake of ribociclib and palbociclib at the blood\u2010CSF barrier resulted in CSF K\np,uu\u00a0>\u00a01.0. By contrary, ABCB1 played a minor role in the BBB or CSF penetration of abemaciclib because of the insignificant ABCB1 intrinsic clearance of abemaciclib. The PBPK model predictions supported the notion that CSF concentrations may be useful as a reflection of unbound drug brain concentrations for drugs (e.g., abemaciclib) that pass the BBB and blood\u2010CSF barrier mainly by passive transcellular permeability, whereas for drugs (e.g., ribociclib and palbociclib) that undergo dominant active transport at the BBB and blood\u2010CSF barrier, the relationship between unbound drug brain and CSF concentrations may not be obvious.\n36\nRefining dosing regimens\n          Target engagement ratio, defined as the ratio of the average steady\u2010state unbound drug brain concentration to the in vitro IC50 for CDK4/6 inhibition, was used as a crude predictor of efficacy.\n15\n Theoretically, a target engagement ratio \u2265\u00a01 would lead to 50% or greater inhibition of CDK4/6. Abemaciclib is the most potent CDK4/6 inhibitor (with the in vitro IC50 of 2 and 10\u00a0nM for inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6, respectively) as compared with palbociclib (IC50, 11 and 15\u00a0nM) and ribociclib (IC50, 10 and 39\u00a0nM).\n13\n Simulations following the standard dosing regimens suggested that the predicted population mean brain C\nss,ave of unbound ribociclib, palbociclib, and abemaciclib were 0.024, 0.004, and 0.052\u00a0\u00b5mol/L, respectively, and correspondingly the CDK4/6 target engagement ratios were 2.4/0.62 for ribociclib, 0.36/0.27 for palbociclib, and 26/5.2 for abemaciclib (Table\n\n3\n). Based on the criterion of target engagement ratio \u2265\u00a01 required for potential clinical efficacy, abemaciclib achieved adequate inhibition for CDK4 and CDK6 in the human brain at the standard dosing regimen (150\u00a0mg b.i.d.). However, ribociclib may sufficiently inhibit CDK4, but not CDK6 in the brain at the standard dosing regimen (600\u00a0mg q.d.). Palbociclib did not achieve adequate brain concentrations to inhibit CDK4 or CDK6 following the standard dosing regimen (125\u00a0mg q.d.).\n          Additional simulations were performed to refine dosing regimens (Figure\n\n4\n). Following 21\u2010day treatment of ribociclib at the maximum tolerated dose (900\u00a0mg q.d.), the simulated population mean brain Css,ave of unbound ribociclib was 0.036\u00a0\u00b5mol/L and the corresponding CDK4/6 target engagement ratios were 3.6/0.92 (Table\n\n3\n), indicating that the treatment of ribociclib at the maximum tolerated dose may sufficiently inhibit both CDK4 and CDK6. However, palbociclib did not achieve sufficient brain concentration for CDK4/6 inhibition (target engagement ratios <\u00a00.5) even at a dose 50% higher than the standard dose (Table\n\n3\n). For abemaciclib, simulations suggested that 150\u00a0mg b.i.d. and 300\u00a0mg q.d. dosing resulted in comparable unbound brain exposure in terms of the maximum, trough, or average steady\u2010state brain concentrations of unbound abemaciclib (Table\n\n3\n).\nDISCUSSION\n      Despite extensive efforts, progress in developing effective therapies for primary and metastatic brain cancer has been disappointing. Lack of efficacy may stem from genetically heterogeneous features of the tumor, emergence of intrinsic resistance mechanisms, and, particularly, poor penetration of potentially effective therapeutic agents across the human BBB.\n37\n, \n38\n, \n39\n The BBB is a dynamic interface separating the brain parenchyma from the circulatory system, which protects the CNS from potentially harmful chemicals while regulating transport of essential molecules and maintaining the homeostasis of the CNS.\n39\n The structure and function of the BBB in brain tumors is often disrupted and heterogeneous.\n40\n, \n41\n, \n42\n For example, glioblastoma consists of different regions presenting various degrees of BBB integrity varying from completely compromised in bulky tumor areas, slightly \u201cleaky\u201d in invasive peripheral regions, and to completely intact in infiltrating tumor regions.\n17\n, \n20\n, \n40\n, \n41\n, \n42\n In spite of enhanced drug penetration into bulky tumor areas, insufficient penetration of potentially effective therapeutic agents into invasive, infiltrative tumor regions or micro\u2010metastases behind an intact BBB, which are often unresectable and give rise to recurrent disease, is a significant barrier to long\u2010term, efficacious treatments.\n17\n Therefore, both primary and metastatic brain cancer should be treated as a disease of the whole brain. A potentially clinical successful therapeutic agent must penetrate across the intact human BBB to achieve adequate pharmacologically active concentrations in the brain. When selecting drug candidates and designing dosing regimens for brain cancer treatment, one needs to consider the drug brain penetration, system pharmacokinetics, and potency for target inhibition.\n      The K\np,uu, as the measure of the extent of drug brain penetration, is a key parameter considered in CNS drug discovery and development. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that brain exposure to unbound drug, which drives pharmacological activity and efficacy, is determined by both the K\np,uu and systemic (or plasma) drug exposure. PBPK model simulations, supported by in vitro cellular permeability and transporter kinetic data, suggest that the transport of abemaciclib at the human BBB is dominated by passive permeability resulting in a K\np,uu of ~\u00a01.0, whereas the transport of ribociclib (K\np,uu 0.14) and palbociclib (K\np,uu 0.12) is dominated by ABCB1/ABCG2\u2010medidated active efflux. Notably, although ribociclib and palbociclib share similar K\np,uu, unbound ribociclib brain concentration is greater than five\u2010fold higher than palbociclib following the standard dosing regimens (Table\n\n3\n). Likewise, although the extent of brain penetration of abemaciclib is approximately sevenfold larger than ribociclib (K\np,uu, 1.0 vs. 0.14), the brain exposure to two drugs only differs by about twofold following the standard dosing regimens (Table\n\n3\n). The relatively higher unbound ribociclib brain exposure is largely driven by its higher unbound plasma exposure. For example, the population mean plasma C\nss,ave of unbound ribociclib is ~\u00a06.\u2010fold and 3.5\u2010fold of that for palbociclib and abemaciclib, respectively, following the standard dosing regimens (Table\n\n3\n). Hence, in spite of a relatively low K\np,uu, ribociclib has the potential to achieve adequate target inhibition in the brain at the maximum tolerate dose. These data underscore the importance for consideration of not only the extend of brain penetration (K\np,uu) but also drug plasma exposure achievable at a safe or tolerable amount when selecting candidate drugs for brain cancer treatment.\n      Another critical consideration is the drug potency for target inhibition. In light of the notion that adequate target inhibition is the prerequisite for clinical efficacy, the target engagement ratio, which takes into account both unbound drug brain concentration and the potency for target inhibition, appears to be the best criteria for selection of brain cancer therapeutic agents. It has been demonstrated that the adequate inhibition of cyclin D\u2010CDK4/6\u2010Rb pathway (as indicated by a decrease in pRb >\u00a060% in skin) is significantly associated with the clinical efficacy (stable disease or response) of abemaciclib in patients with HR\u2010positive breast cancer.\n14\n In our study, a target engagement ratio \u2265\u00a01 achieved in the normal brain is used as the threshold to ensure CDK4/6 inhibition in brain tumors especially in microscopic tumor regions behind an intact BBB. Abemaciclib is the most potent CDK4/6 inhibitor as compared with palbociclib and ribociclib.\n13\n In addition, abemaciclib exhibits excellent brain penetration (K\np,uu, 1.0) and reasonably good systemic exposure. These together lead to abemaciclib target engagement ratio of 26 (for CDK4) and 5.2 (for CDK6) following the standard dosing regimen. The potential clinical efficacy of abemaciclib for brain cancer treatment has been demonstrated in a phase I/II clinical trial in which 3 patients with glioblastoma achieved stable disease on single\u2010agent abemaciclib treatment, and 2 of them continued the treatment without progression for nearly 2\u00a0years.\n14\n By contrary, because of the low brain exposure and modest potency of palbociclib, the CDK4/6 target engagement ratio is <\u00a00.5 even at a dose 50% higher than the standard dose. On the other hand, due to the relatively low potency for CDK4/6 inhibition, ribociclib may sufficiently inhibit CDK4 (target engagement ratio, 2.4) but not CDK6 (target engagement ratio, 0.62) although it achieves similar brain exposure as abemaciclib following the standard dosing regimens. These data collectively suggest that abemaciclib is the best CDK4/6 inhibitor for brain cancer treatment, whereas palbociclib is not recommended to use. Ribociclib has the potential to sufficiently inhibit both CDK4 and CDK6 at the maximum tolerated dose.\n      Different dosing strategies have been used for the three CDK4/6 inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer, given their different system pharmacokinetics and clinical toxicities. Due to significant myelotoxicity, ribociclib and palbociclib require an intermittent dosing schedule (3\u2010weeks\u2010on/1\u2010week\u2010off) to allow bone marrow recovery. By contrast, abemaciclib has a safety profile allowing continuous dosing schedule (4\u2010week\u2010on), which provides important opportunities for combining abemaciclib with a variety of targeted or cytotoxic agents. Previous clinical study suggests that the administration of abemaciclib at 200\u00a0mg or 150\u00a0mg b.i.d. can achieve sustained pharmacodynamic effects in proliferating keratinocytes and tumors in patients with non\u2010CNS cancers, including breast cancer, non\u2010small cell lung cancer, and melanoma.\n14\n Hence, 200\u00a0mg and 150\u00a0mg b.i.d. was recommended as the starting dose for single\u2010agent and combination treatment, respectively. However, because of the reasonable plasma elimination half\u2010life of abemaciclib (observed vs. PBPK\u2010model predicted population mean T\n1/2, 22 vs. 20\u00a0hours) and a broad dose range associated with clinical efficacy, a once\u2010daily dosing schedule may also achieve sustained target inhibition in the human brain. PBPK simulations suggest that 150\u00a0mg b.i.d. and 300\u00a0mg q.d. dosing result in comparable plasma or brain exposure to unbound abemaciclib in terms of the maximum, trough, or average steady\u2010state concentrations (Table\n\n3\n and Figure\n\n4\n). Notably, similar to slow\u2010released formulations, the slow BBB penetration, and sustained brain retention of abemaciclib result in a small fluctuation between the peak and trough steady\u2010state brain concentrations following either twice\u2010daily or once\u2010daily dosing (Figure\n\n4\n). Thus, 300\u00a0mg q.d. dosing would be expected to produce a similar, if not better, safety profile and clinical efficacy as 150\u00a0mg b.i.d. dosing. Considering the treatment convenience and likely better safety profile for once\u2010daily dosing, it would be reasonable to initiate abemaciclib for brain cancer treatment at 300\u00a0mg q.d. on a 4\u2010weeks\u2010on continuous schedule. Further prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm the refined dosing regimen.\nFunding\n      This study was funded by the United States National Institute of Health (NIH) Cancer Center Support Grant P30 CA022453.\nConflict of Interest\n      The authors declared no competing interests for this work.\nAuthor Contributions\n      J.L. wrote the manuscript.
