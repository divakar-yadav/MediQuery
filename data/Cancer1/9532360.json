    "title": "Selective cell size MRI differentiates brain tumors from radiation necrosis",
    "abstract": "Brain metastasis is a common characteristic of late-stage lung cancers. High doses of targeted \nradiation can control tumor growth in the brain but can also result in radiation-induced necrosis. \nCurrent methods are limited for distinguishing whether new parenchymal lesions following \nradiotherapy are recurrent tumors or radiation-induced necrosis, but the clinical management of \nthese two classes of lesions differs significantly. Here we developed, validated, and evaluated a \nnew MRI technique termed selective size imaging using filters via diffusion times (SSIFT) to \ndifferentiate brain tumors from radiation necrosis in the brain. This approach generates a signal \nfilter that leverages diffusion time dependence to establish a cell-size-weighted map. Computer \nsimulations in silico, cultured cancer cells in vitro, and animals with brain tumors in vivo were \nused to comprehensively validate the specificity of SSIFT for detecting typical large cancer cells \n*Corresponding author: Correspondence to Junzhong Xu. junzhong.xu@vanderbilt.edu.
