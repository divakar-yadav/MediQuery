    "abstract": "High-grade brain cancer such as glioblastoma (GBM) remains an incurable disease. A common \nfeature of GBM is the angiogenic vasculature, which can be targeted with selected peptides for \npayload delivery. We assessed the ability of micelle-tagged, vascular homing peptides RGR, \nCGKRK and NGR to specifically bind to blood vessels in syngeneic orthotopic GBM models. By \nusing the peptide CGKRK to deliver the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily member \nLIGHT (also known as TNF superfamily member 14; TNFSF14) to angiogenic tumour vessels, we \nhave generated a reagent that normalizes the brain cancer vasculature by inducing pericyte \ncontractility and re-establishing endothelial barrier integrity. LIGHT-mediated vascular \nremodelling also activates endothelia and induces intratumoural high endothelial venules (HEVs), \nwhich are specialized blood vessels for lymphocyte infiltration. Combining CGKRK\u2013LIGHT with \nanti-vascular endothelial growth factor and checkpoint blockade amplified HEV frequency and T-\ncell accumulation in GBM, which is often sparsely infiltrated by immune effector cells, and \nreduced tumour burden. Furthermore, CGKRK and RGR peptides strongly bound to blood vessels \nin freshly resected human GBM, demonstrating shared peptide-binding activities in mouse and \n*Correspondence to: R Ganss, The Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research, 6 Verdun Street, Nedlands, Western Australia 6009, \nAustralia. ganss@perkins.uwa.edu.au.\nAuthor contributions statement\nRG, GB, GL and AKN conceived and designed the study.
