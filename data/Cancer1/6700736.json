    "title": "Barriers to Effective Drug Treatment for Brain Metastases: A Multifactorial Problem in the Delivery of Precision Medicine",
    "abstract": "The treatment of metastatic lesions in the brain represents a serious unmet medical need in the \nfield of neurooncology. Even though many effective compounds have demonstrated success in \ntreating peripheral (non-CNS) tumors with targeted agents, one aspect of this lack of success in the \nbrain may be related to poor delivery of otherwise effective compounds. Many factors can \ninfluence the brain delivery of these agents, but one key barrier is a heterogeneously \u201cleaky\u201d BBB \nthat expresses efflux transporters that limit the BBB permeability for many targeted agents. Future \nsuccess in therapeutics for brain metastases must take into account the adequate delivery of \n\u201cactive, free drug\u201d to the target, and may include combinations of targeted drugs that are \nappropriate to address each individual patient\u2019s tumor type. This review discusses some issues that \nare pertinent to precision medicine for brain metastases, using specific examples of tumor types \nthat have a high incidence of brain metastases.\nKeywords\nblood-brain barrier; brain metastases; drug delivery; efflux transporters; metastasize; molecularly-\ntargeted anti-cancer agents",
