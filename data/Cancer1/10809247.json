    "title": "Lipidomic-Based Approach to 10 s Classification of Major Pediatric Brain Cancer Types with Picosecond Infrared Laser Mass Spectrometry",
    "abstract": ": Picosecond infrared laser mass spectrometry (PIRL-\nMS) is shown, through a retrospective patient tissue study, to\ndifferentiate medulloblastoma cancers from pilocytic astrocytoma\nand two molecular subtypes of ependymoma (PF-EPN-A, ST-EPN-\nRELA) using laser-extracted lipids profiled with PIRL-MS in 10 s of\nsampling and analysis time. The average sensitivity and specificity\nvalues for this classification, taking genomic profiling data as\nstandard, were 96.41 and 99.54%, and this classification used many\nmolecular features resolvable in 10 s PIRL-MS spectra. Data\nanalysis and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem high-\nresolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) further allowed us to\nreduce the molecular feature list to only 18 metabolic lipid markers\nmost strongly involved in this classification. The identified\n\u2018metabolite array\u2019 was comprised of a variety of phosphatidic and fatty acids, ceramides, and phosphatidylcholine/ethanolamine\nand could mediate the above-mentioned classification with average sensitivity and specificity values of 94.39 and 98.78%,\nrespectively, at a 95% confidence in prediction probability threshold. Therefore, a rapid and accurate pathology classification of select\npediatric brain cancer types from 10 s PIRL-MS analysis using known metabolic biomarkers can now be available to the\nneurosurgeon. Based on retrospective mining of \u2018survival\u2019 versus \u2018extent-of-resection\u2019 data, we further identified pediatric cancer\ntypes that may benefit from actionable 10 s PIRL-MS pathology feedback. In such cases, aggressiveness of the surgical resection can\nbe optimized in a manner that is expected to benefit the patient\u2019s overall or progression-free survival. PIRL-MS is a promising tool to\ndrive such personalized decision-making in the operating theater.\n\u25a0",

    "description": "Introduction\n      Capitalizing on the morphological differences\nbetween cancer and\nhealthy cells (accentuated with staining for microscopy), intraoperative\n[pathology] consultations (IOCs) have been indispensable to guide\nmany surgical interventions in cancer care,1 including adult,2 and pediatric neurosurgery.3 Recent advances in understanding molecular heterogeneities\nof brain cancers have led to the discovery of many prognostically\nor diagnostically important molecular subtypes,4 motivating an \u2019integrated diagnosis\u2019 approach\nwhere both morphological and molecular features are distinguished.5 Determining cancer molecular subtypes, however,\nis not possible with current IOC methods that lack molecular-level\n\u201cresolution\u201d due to long analysis times beyond what\nis afforded on intrasurgical timescales. This inherent limitation\nhas hindered access to a wealth of prognostic molecular-level information\nthat could otherwise be available to the neurosurgeon to drive personalized\ndecision-making in the operating room. Therefore, conventional IOC\nmethods must be augmented with rapid orthogonal molecular analyses\nto enable integrated diagnosis in an actionable manner on intrasurgical\ntimescales. This is of importance in neurosurgery where preoperative\nbiopsies are often uncommon and crucial decisions such as stratification\nof surgical risk and suitable resection extent(s) for optimal outcome\nmust be made rapidly (<30 min) while patients await pathology results\nunder anesthesia. In a similar vein, the diagnostic accuracy of current\nIOC methods heavily depends on the availability and experience level\nof the (neuro)pathologist on call.2 As\nsuch, a strong impetus has been created for developing nonsubjective\nmethods of integrated diagnosis for central nervous system tumors\ndifferentiating cancer subtypes based on both morphological and molecular\nfeatures on intrasurgical timescales in a manner that the accuracy\nand depth of pathology information delivered are uninfluenced by the\nskill, experience, and availability of a highly trained neuropathologist.4 To this end, a previous publication from our\ngroup has reported the utility of picosecond infrared laser mass spectrometry\n(PIRL-MS) for high-sensitivity and specificity (>97%) differentiation\nof morphologically identical yet molecularly distinct subgroups of\nthe pediatric brain cancer medulloblastoma in only 10 s of data collection\nand analysis time.6 PIRL-MS is an ambient\nmass spectrometry analysis method that much like other rapid ambient\nmass spectrometry analysis methods, such as (but not limited to) the\niKnife or the MasSpec Pen reviewed elsewhere,7\u221210 is capable of recognizing various\ntissue pathologies based on cancer-specific small molecules or oncometabolites\nunique to each cancer type or molecular subtype thereof, brought to\nthe gas phase by a suitable desorption mechanism (a picosecond mid-infrared\nlaser in case of PIRL-MS) for uptake and analysis by mass spectrometry.\nPIRL-MS classifications are often mediated by metabolic lipids6,12 that are modulated during cancer formation and progression.13 Here, identifying a cancer type requires a comparison\nbetween the PIRL-MS profile of the specimen under study and a validated\nPIRL-MS profile library of cancer types. Such a molecular profile\nlibrary must be available a priori to the analysis of the unknown\nclinical specimen.\n      In this study, we examined the utility of\nPIRL-MS as a rapid method\nfor differentiating major pediatric brain cancer types of pilocytic\nastrocytoma and ependymoma (two of its morphologically identical subtypes\nPF-EPN-A and ST-EPN-RELA) from medulloblastoma and its molecular subgroups\n(previously shown to be resolvable with 10 s PIRL-MS sampling into\nits 4 canonical molecular subgroups4,6). While subgrouping\nmedulloblastoma cancers into their prognostically important 4 subgroups\nas reported by our group6 is of clinical\nimportance, the \u201cspecificity\u201d of PIRL-MS signatures\nof medulloblastoma must be evaluated in the context of other major\npediatric brain cancers that could be in diagnostic competition with\nmedulloblastoma cancers. To address this point, capitalizing on the\nclose coupling between cancer formation and lipid metabolism,13 we further report a fully characterized \u201cmetabolic\nmarker array\u201d for high-sensitivity and high-specificity (\u223c95%)\nclassification of medulloblastoma, pilocytic astrocytoma, and ependymoma\ncancer types not addressed in our previous work.6 This molecular metabolite array, in combination with our\nprevious demonstration of utility of PIRL-MS in medulloblastoma subgroup\nidentification, can form the basis of a rapid pediatric brain cancer\npathology determination platform capable of simultaneous classifications\nof morphologically and molecularly distinct cancer types (or subtypes)\nusing laser-extracted tissue metabolites analyzed with mass spectrometry\nin only 10 s. Currently, high-sensitivity and high-specificity molecular\npathology classifications are possible only via postoperative (or\npermanent) pathology methods, such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) or\ngenetic sequencing. The analysis times (turnaround time) of these\nmethods are long and are about one day at best and often much longer\nin real-world conditions. Fortunately, ambient analysis with PIRL-MS\nutilizes downstream metabolites examined in a matter of seconds, enabling\naccurate integrated molecular diagnoses4 on intrasurgical timescales. Based on our results, an adjunct tool\ncan be envisioned utilizing PIRL-MS to bring molecular pathology capabilities\nto current IOC workflows of pediatric neurosurgery. Expansion of PIRL-MS\nto other diagnostically important molecular types of brain cancers\nis expected to reduce the turnaround time of \u2018integrated diagnoses\nfor central nervous system cancers\u2019.4\nExperimental Section\n      \n        Pathology Annotation\n        Medulloblastoma\nspecimens analyzed\npreviously and published were subgrouped using NanoString and methylation\nprofiling.6 This manuscript predominantly\nuses NanoString14 to classifying MB subgroups.\nNanoString is particularly accurate for WNT and SHH subgroups,15 and further suitable for a clear distinction\nof Groups 3 and 4 with the exception of small subset of overlapping\ncases.16 Capitalizing on the observed discordance\nbetween methylation profiling and NanoString being relatively low,\nin a few cases methylation profiling data was used instead.17 Ependymoma and pilocytic astrocytoma specimens\nwere annotated using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) assessment post\nPIRL-MS sampling.

For this previous work to garner clinical impact,\naccurate diagnosis of medulloblastoma must be demonstrated in the\npresence of other pediatric brain cancers. For this purpose, pilocytic\nastrocytoma (PA) and ependymoma (EPN) specimens were subjected to\nthe same PIRL-MS analysis where EPN specimens were further subdivided\ninto two subtypes of posterior fossa PF-EPN-A and supratentorial ST-EPN-RELA4 that we had available to us for analysis as a\nproxy for morphologically identical subtypes unsuitable for diagnosis\nusing intraoperative frozen section H&E. We chose PF-EPN-A cancer\nas this type occurs most frequently in the posterior fossa, and of\nthe supratentorial EPN cancers, those that harbor RELA fusion are\nmost common.20,21\n      Figure 1 shows the\nrepresentative 10 s PIRL-MS spectra of these specimens alongside a\npreviously published typical spectrum of medulloblastoma (Group 4).\nThe results suggest that major pediatric brain cancer types possess\ngood-quality PIRL-MS spectra with well-resolved spectral features\nover the m/z 100\u20131000 range.\nTo address potential influence of tissue heterogeneity on mass spectra,\nmultiple 10 s PIRL-MS samplings were performed across each specimen\u2019s\nsurface. To ensure that no adverse mass spectral feature overlap with\nmedulloblastoma data leading to misclassification took place, this\ndata was combined with previously published PIRL-MS spectra of medulloblastoma6 and was subjected to dimensionality reduction\nwith principal component analysis linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA). Figure S1 shows the multivariate PCA-LDA \u201cscore\nplot\u201d of 349, 10 s PIRL-MS spectra from the major pediatric\nbrain cancer types of PF-EPN-A (n = 4), ST-EPN-RELA\n(n = 3), pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) n = 15 (all reported in this paper for the first time), and previously\npublished6 medulloblastomas data from n = 72 specimens across all canonical subgroups of WNT,\nSHH, Group 3, and Group 4. This model aims to simultaneously separate\nmajor pediatric brain cancers broken down into relevant molecular\nsubtypes or subgroups forming seven \u201cclasses\u201d. While\nmedulloblastoma subgroups were grouped closely together, a separate\ngrouping of PF-EPN-A, ST-EPN-RELA, pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), and\nmedulloblastoma (MB) data points was observed, suggesting that typical\nmass spectral features resolved with rapid 10 s PIRL-MS measurements\nin Figure 1 are sufficiently\ndistinct to allow deconvolution of results based on major pediatric\nbrain cancer types and relevant molecular subtypes or subgroups shown. Table S1 reports the \u201ccross-validation\u201d\nstatistics for this seven-class model (Figure S1) utilizing both a 20% and \u201cfull-group\u201d leave-out\ntest wherein intra- and interspecimen variance from PIRL-MS analysis,\nrespectively, are calculated and compared (see the Supporting information and Experimental Section for a detailed\ndescription of each test). As shown in this table, cross-validation\nstatistics of 95.83 and 98.47% were obtained. The convergence of the\ncross-validation metrics using the two methods employed suggests that\nintrasample molecular (and thus mass spectral) heterogeneities are\nsmall and on the order of intersample variance at the molecular level\nover the m/z range examined. In\naddition, Table S1 cross-validation results\nsuggest that the PCA-LDA model of Figure S1 may be of reasonable diagnostic value for rapid classification of\npediatric brain tumor types and select molecular subgroups or subtypes\nthereof. To test this \u201chypothesis\u201d, we attempted to\nclassify an additional 62 specimens of PF-EPN-A (n = 9), ST-EPN-RELA (n = 2), pilocytic astrocytoma\n(n = 10), and medulloblastoma (n = 41) (WNT, n = 6; SHH, n = 10;\nGroup 3, n = 12; Group 4, n = 13,\nsubgrouped with NanoString with associated confidence \u223c90%)\nvia \u201cMahalanobis distance\u201d22 measurements between the PCA-LDA model shown in Figure S1 and the query data, as we have done previously.6,19 We deliberately used the Figure S1 PCA-LDA\nmodel that contained multiple samplings across each independent specimen\u2019s\nsurface as this model (from Table S1 results)\nsufficiently captured the expected intraspecimen variance, in addition\nto interspecimen variance carried within. Table S2 summarizes the sensitivity and specificity results of these\nclassifications. As can be seen here, while the average sensitivity\nand specificity values of 91.54 and 99.04% across all seven classes\nof PF-EPN-A, ST-EPN-RELA, pilocytic astrocytoma, medulloblastoma-WNT,\nmedulloblastoma-SHH, medulloblastoma-Group 3, and medulloblastoma-Group\n4 were obtained, lower than 95% sensitivity was observed in 4 classes\nincluding some subgroups of medulloblastoma that in the Figure S1 PCA-LDA model are very closely grouped\ntogether. This observation motivated us to therefore explore a two-step\n\u201csupervised\u201d modeling approach that first separates\nmedulloblastomas from pilocytic astrocytoma, PF-EPN-A, and ST-EPN-RELA\nsuch that further subgrouping of medulloblastoma cancers could take\nplace using the previously published medulloblastoma classifiers (with\nPCA-LDA) over the m/z range of 500\u20131000\nwith average sensitivity and specificity of >97%.6Figure S2 shows this 4-component\nPCA-LDA model that offers a 100% cross-validation accuracy across\nboth 20% and full-group leave out (Table S3) and further capable of classifying 41 additional medulloblastoma,\n10 additional pilocytic astrocytoma, 9 additional PF-EPN-A, and 2\nadditional ST-EPN-RELA specimens with improved average sensitivity\nand specificity values of 96.41 and 99.54% (Table S4). Compared to the 7-component PCA-LDA model of Figure S1, this approach allows higher than 95%\nsensitivity while maintaining the specificity of classification to\n> 99%. In combination with previous PCA-LDA published model for\nfurther\nsubgrouping of medulloblastomas with sensitivity and specificity values\nof > 97%,6 this approaches the performance\nlevels expected from a clinical assay.\n      \n        Figure 1\n        \n          Representative 10 s PIRL-MS\nspectra of major pediatric brain cancer\ntypes. The PIRL-MS spectra for ependymoma (EPN) (PF-EPN-A, ST-EPN-RELA),\npilocytic astrocytoma (PA), and medulloblastoma (MB, e.g., Group 4\nsubgroup) are shown to possess unique mass spectral differentiators.\nThe mass-to-charge (m/z) values\nresponsible for 10 s classification of these cancer types whose molecular\nidentities are determined in this work (see Table 1) are labeled in the black font. The m/z values in the red font represent the\nabundant ions over the mass range examined. We have also included\nthe total ion count for each mass spectrum, suggesting good-quality\nmass spectra from these specimens could be obtained under the proposed\nexperimental conditions. The MB data is previously published6 and is reproduced here for the clarity of discussion\nand to ensure that no misclassification of newly analyzed EPN and\nPA specimens as MB is taking place.\n        \n        \n      \n      While seemingly successful, molecular-level variances in cancer\nlipidomes at the population level (due to diet and other factors23\u221225) could hamper the utility of the Figure S2 approach that utilizes many uncharacterized m/z features. This is likely to increase the potential for\nmetabolic \u201ccrosstalk\u201d with m/z values affected at the population level as reviewed previously.24 While the utility of the Figure S2 model for high-specificity and high-sensitivity\nclassification of pediatric brain cancers reported in Table S4 must be revisited in a large(er) trial,\nwe attempted to characterize the molecular identities of m/z features most strongly differentiating between\npediatric brain cancers studied herein. We reasoned that a well-characterized\n\u201cmetabolite array\u201d for the robust classification of\npediatric brain cancer types based on fully identified metabolites\n(as opposed to unknown mass spectral m/z features) could potentially shield against high-variance m/z values encountered at the population\nlevel. To establish potential candidates (i.e., cancer-differentiating m/z values), we created two PCA-LDA models;\none that would distinguish ependymoma from pilocytic astrocytoma and\nfrom medulloblastoma (using n = 7, 15, 72 specimens,\nrespectively) and the other that would distinguish the two subtypes\nof ependymoma (PF-EPN-A and ST-EPN-RELA) from one another using n = 4 and n = 3 specimens, respectively.\nWe reasoned that this two-step modeling may allow us to more effectively\ndiscover (to then combine) the most discriminating m/z important in each independent model for simultaneous\nuse in combination with a feature-based version of the Figure S2 model that only uses the discovered\nbiomarker ions as classifiers. These models (Figure S3) possess favorable > 97% cross-validation statistics\n(Table S5) and can be used robustly for\ncreation\nof \u201cloading plots\u201d wherein we have highlighted the top\nmass-to-charge (m/z) values most\nstrongly responsible for ependymoma, pilocytic astrocytoma, and medulloblastoma\ndiscriminations as well as those responsible for discriminating PF-EPN-A\nand ST-EPN-RELA subtypes of ependymoma (Figure S4). To determine the molecular identities of these m/z values, we subjected a lipid extract\nof 2 ependymoma (1 PF-EPN-A and 1 ST-EPN-RELA) and 1 pilocytic astrocytoma\nrepresentative specimens to chromatography and tandem high-resolution\nmass spectrometry and were able to determine the molecular identities\nof 18 biomarker ions for this differentiation (Table 1).\n      \n        Table 1\n

isotopic ratio based on\nhits included in the LipidMaps online tool (see the Experimental Section).\nWe have included observed and theoretical masses, ion forms, diagnostic\nfragments, proposed assignments, and calculated shift from theoretical\nmass (in ppm) as done previously.6 Where\nthe tentative assignment is given only through accurate mass comparison,\nwe have indicated so. Note that for m/z 792.74, PC(38:5)\nfragments show mixtures of PC(16:0/22:5) and PC(18:1/20:4).\n          \n        \n      \n      To examine the relevance of Table 1 biomarker list, we\nrebuilt the Figure S2 PCA-LDA model only\nbased on the 18 m/z values reported\nin Table 1. This \u201csparse\u201d\nor \u201clow-complexity\u201d\nfeature-based molecular model is shown in Figure 2 and possesses 95.70 and 87.28% accuracy\nfrom cross-validation statistics using 20% and full-group leave-out\napproaches (Table S6). These values are\nlower than those listed in Table S3 for\nthe same PCA-LDA model that uses many uncharacterized features across\nthe full m/z range (shown in Figure S2). This means that m/z features beyond the 18 successfully reported\nin Table 1 are required\nfor improved cross-validation statistics. However, as shown in Table 2, this \u201clow-complexity\u201d feature-based model\nthat only uses characterized m/z ions of known stipulated composition can classify pediatric brain\ncancer types of medulloblastoma, pilocytic astrocytoma, PF-EPN-A,\nand ST-EPN-RELA with average sensitivity and specificity values of\n89.08 and 97.50%, respectively (Table 2). Further, restricting predictions to only sampling\nevents that showed high (>95%) confidence in class predictions\nbased\non Mahalanobis distances (raw data is presented in Table S7) improves the sensitivity and specificity to 94.39\nand 98.78%, respectively. This observation allows classification of\nPF-EPN-A, ST-EPN-RELA, pilocytic astrocytoma, and medulloblastomas\nwith >94% sensitivity and specificity using a fully characterized\nion list presented in Table 1. These values are not drastically lower than those from the\nfull-range model (96.41 and 99.54% in Table S4 for the Figure S2 PCA-LDA model). This\nis encouraging and suggests that feature-based classification using\nrationally selected and then identified m/z values most strongly responsible for class discriminations\nis a viable avenue for 10 s classification of major pediatric brain\ncancer types with ambient PIRL-MS profiling. Additionally, we report\nsuch biomarkers for future investigations of molecular pathways involved\nor the development of orthogonal assays based on this report. However,\nadditional insights can be gleaned by turning the focus onto select\ncases of prediction failures. To this end, further inspection of Table 2 results suggests\nthat PF-EPN-A possesses the lowest sensitivity in predictions based\non PIRL-MS results (77.55% at the 95% threshold). Interestingly, however,\nthe main culprit for this low sensitivity can be tracked down to two\nrecurrent ependymoma specimens (2301 and 1455, Table S7) only, as detailed below. Removing those two specimens\nfrom the calculations improved the average sensitivity of the metabolite\narray model from 94.39 to 98.13% and the sensitivity of the PF-EPN-A\nspecifically from 77.55 to 92.5%. PF-EPN-A is often present in the\nposterior fossa region of the brain, while ST-EPN-RELA dominates the\nsupratentorial region. The excluded specimens were recurrences located\nin the supratentorial (ST) region. In one of these (sample 2301 in Table S7), its small size only allowed us to\ncollect 3 measurements, 2 of which were of poor quality (and as such\nhad little impact on the results) but the other (sample 1455, Table S7) had 11 events, 9 of which classified\nas ST-EPN-RELA rather than PF-EPN-A in the metabolite array model.\nIn the full m/z range models presented\nin Figures S1\u2013S3, most of these\npoints fell too far from any group to classify and thus (as unclassifiable\ndata points) did not contribute to the sensitivity and specificity\ncalculations. As our model was built without any PF-EPN-A tumors from\nthe supratentorial (ST) region, it is conceivable to assume that the\nmodel could have struggled to classify these specimens. Interestingly,\nhistopathologic evaluation (Table S8) failed\nto uncover infiltration of healthy brain tissue from the supratentorial\nregion into sample 1455 as a driver for said misclassification. Therefore,\nthe location of EPN cancer seems to have an influence on its PIRL-MS\nmolecular signatures (at least based on our highly limited data that\nmust be investigated further). This may highlight a current failing\nwith respect to the comprehensiveness of the molecular model presented\nas it fails to address PF-EPN-A recurrences in the supratentorial\n(ST) region, but with access to additional specimens, m/z features that drive this shift could be identified.\n      \n        Table 2\n        \n          Sensitivity and Specificity Calculations\nfor Blind Sample Predictions Using the Characterized Metabolite Arraya\n        \n        \n        \n          \n            a\n            Here, we used the sparse low-complexity\nPCA-LDA model of Figure 2 that uses the 18 metabolites of Table 1 to calculate the\nsensitivity and specificity of pediatric cancer-type predictions using\nsame unknown specimens used in the Figure S2 model reported in Table S4 using uncharacterized\nspectral features across the entire m/z 100\u20131000\nrange. Table S4 legend reports details\nnecessary for readers with respect to blind sample classifications,\nreporting, and calculations of sensitivity and specificity values.\nIn this table, however, we presented the sensitivity and specificity\ncalculations across two Mahalanobis distance confidence in prediction\nintervals of raw data (see Table S7) and\nonly positive hits with >95% in prediction probability. For this\n\u2018probability\nthresholding\u2019 to take place, we excluded classifications whose\nprobability of prediction was less than 95% (underlined in Table S7) from sensitivity and specificity calculations.\nAverage sensitivity values without and with 95% confidence thresholding,\nrespectively, were calculated from 75.00, 88.24, 93.10, 100% (for\n89.08%), and 77.55, 100, 100, 100% (for 94.39%). Average specificity\nvalues in the same vein were calculated as follows: 97.27, 95.13,\n97.60, 100% (for 97.50%) and 100, 96.22, 98.88, 100% (for 98.77%).\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        Figure 2\n        \n          Sparse Figure S2 PCA-LDA model based\non 18 identified metabolites listed in Table 1. This model is based on a sparse (or low\ncomplexity) PCA-LDA modeling using AMX6,19 that instead\nof using the entire m/z 100\u20131000\nrange worth of m/z features as done\nin Figure S2, only utilizes the fully characterized\nmetabolite array of Table 1. Here, the multivariate model is built only based on simultaneous\ndimensionality reduction across only 18 features whose molecular identities\nare determined and reported in Table 1. We show two views of the model (rotated around the\nLD3, blue axis). LD1 and LD2 axes are shown in red and green, respectively.\n        \n        \n      \n      Contextualizing PIRL-MS classifications for each\nof the clinical\nspecimens used (Table S7) and considering\nhistopathologic evaluations provided in Table S8 highlight a few additional points. First, the specimens\nused for model building contained several heterogeneities such as\ninfiltration of healthy tissue (ST-EPN-RELA 2093, PA 1636, 1841, and\n2958) and necrosis (PF-EPN-A 1427). The presence of these specimens\nin the model is likely to contribute to its success in correctly classifying\ntest specimens with healthy tissue infiltration (PF-EPN-A 151, PA\n2875) and necrosis (ST-EPN-RELA 2537, PA 1585). Interestingly, for\nST-EPN-RELA 2537, the sparse analysis based on the identified tumor-specific\nbiomarkers in Table 1 results in a drastic improvement in the number of sampling events\nthat can be correctly classified with high confidence (see Table S7). In a similar vein, some improvements\nin the classification of PF-EPN-A 151 using the tumor-specific biomarkers\nare also noted. Use of tumor-specific biomarkers also improved the\nclassification of sampling events from PF-EPN-A 752, PF-EPN-A 1134,\nand PA 1255 albeit with lower confidence. Specimen 1134 exhibited\ncautery damage wherein the use of tumor-specific markers assisted\nin improving its classification, perhaps by ignoring cautery-specific\nchanges in the decision-making algorithm that would have otherwise\npossibly altered the information content in the full-range m/z model. Overall, judging by the classification\nresults provided in Table S7, use of sparse\n(or feature-based analysis as opposed to full m/z range) appears to reduce the number of outlier data points,\nand this may in turn improve both the sensitivity and the duty cycle\nof PIRL-MS measurements (40 outliers to only one in the low-complexity\nfeature-based model).\n      Taken all together, we thus propose a\nsupervised two-step sequential\nprotocol for 10 s classification of major pediatric brain cancers\nwith PIRL-MS that first, based on Figure 2 metabolite array sparse feature-based PCA-LDA\nmodel, distinguished medulloblastoma cancers from pilocytic astrocytomas\nand ependymomas with their PF-EPN-A and ST-EPN-RELA subtypes for subsequent\nsubgrouping using previously published results.6 The medulloblastoma subgrouping must utilize many m/z features (500\u20131000 range) but\ndistinguishing other types of pediatric brain cancers could utilize\nonly 18 ions characterized and reported in Table 1. This may not be entirely surprising due\nto molecular similarity between medulloblastoma subgroups that manifests\nitself in close grouping in the PCA-LDA space seen in Figure S1, requiring many more mass spectral\nfeatures to enable its subgrouping with 10 s PIRL-MS data. This vision\nis proposed in Figure 3. Further supporting the validity of this two-step supervised data\nanalysis scheme is the failure of unsupervised clustering methods\nshown in Figure S5 that suggests molecular\nsimilarities between different classes of pediatric brain cancers\nprevent utility of unsupervised methods. In a similar vein, supervised\nmodeling and blind sample predictions using random forest and neuronal\nnetwork as alternatives to the proposed PCA-LDA method did not improve\nthe predictive metrics of the method (Figure S6). As such, further supported by > 94% sensitivity and specificity\nfor PCA-LDA modeling and predictions of 10 s PIRL-MS data of pediatric\nbrain cancers we believe the proposed method shown in Figure 3 constitutes a viable approach\nto form the basis for a suitable data analysis method for bedside\ndecision-making with PIRL-MS. It is, however, conceivable that larger\ndata sets may be more amenable to benefit from machine learning methods.\n      \n        Figure 3\n        \n          Protocol\nfor supervised two-step classification of major pediatric\nbrain cancers using PIRL-MS. Through combining findings of this manuscript\nwith our previous work,6 we propose a two-step\nsupervised protocol for 10 s classification of 7 types of pediatric\nbrain cancers. The method uses two 4-component PCA-LDA models deployed\nover the cited mass ranges to provide higher than 94% sensitivity\nand specificity for pediatric brain-cancer-type classifications. The\nfirst model utilizes well-characterized feature list of only 18 metabolites,\nand the second model that takes a deeper dive into molecular subgroups\nof medulloblastomas will use a considerably larger number of m/z features some of which currently remain\nuncharacterized.\nConclusions and Caveats\n      In this work, we demonstrated 10 s classification of common pediatric\nbrain cancer types with PIRL-MS. While this study used only a small\nnumber of 156 banked specimens (113 MB as previously published6), the inclusion of the final 40% of the specimens\ndid not improve the already acceptable sensitivity and specificity\nof our predictions based on the learning curves presented in Figure S7 for the 4-component PCA-LDA model of Figure S2. This observation suggests that the\nutilized molecular models are likely robust (despite the use of only\ntens of ependymoma and pilocytic astrocytoma specimens) and must be\nfurther validated in a much larger prospective fresh tissue study\n(including rare cancers) for a rigorous assessment of clinical utility.\nHere, murine studies have suggested concordance between fresh and\nfrozen tissue signatures of brain matter.26\n      Furthermore, while the advantage of objective medulloblastoma,\npilocytic astrocytoma, and ependymoma differentiation in 10 s as opposed\nto subjective \u223c30 min or so with intraoperative histopathology\nstaining and microscopy (current IOC standard of care) must be debated,\ndifferentiating between molecular subtypes of ependymoma into ST-EPN-RELA\nand PF-EPN-A cohorts shown here enabled with sensitivity and specificity\nvalues of 90%, 100% (for ST-EPN-RELA) and 95.65%, 100% (based on Table S4 results) must be highlighted. Overall,\nwe believe that the pilot study presented here in conjunction with\npreviously published subgrouping of medulloblastoma in 10 s6 that is not currently possible with conventional\nfrozen section analyses, upon maturity, could enable personalized\ndecision-making in the operating room with respect to resection extents\nbased on scenarios summarized in Table S9. These hypotheses are based on retrospective analysis of \u201csurvival\u201d\nversus \u201cresection-extent\u201d data and must be further validated\nwith patient outcomes from clinical trials.\nSupplementary Material\n      \n        \n          \n            ac3c03156_si_001.pdf\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10809247/\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c03156",
