    "abstract": "They are also categorized into primary and secondary brain cancers based on the site of origin with cancers starting in the brain itself considered to be primary and the brain metastases from other cancers as secondary.2 There were 308,102 new cases and 251,329 fatalities due to brain and CNS cancers worldwide in 2020, according to the GLOBOCAN 2020 report.3 Also, brain cancer has one of the lowest 5% year survival rates among all other cancer types.4 These statistics and the complexity of brain tumors clearly signify the requirement for better diagnostics, monitoring, and treatment techniques. Analyzing of samples via Raman revealed 19 new shifts which have not been reported before representing calcification (975 cm\u20131), collagen (817 cm\u20131), heme content (743 cm\u20131), glycogen (941 cm\u20131), lipids (431, 776, 875, 968 cm\u20131), nucleic acids (498, 780, 825, 894 cm\u20131), and proteins (524, 933, 963, 1031, 1035, 1583, 1603 cm\u20131) (represented in Table 1).7 Kopec et al. suggested that the peaks obtained from aggressive brain tumors at wavenumbers 1004 cm\u20131 (proteins), 1156 and 1520 cm\u20131 (carotenoids), 1585 cm\u20131 (cytochrome), and 1444 and 1655 cm\u20131 (fatty acids) are potential biomarkers for oncological diagnosis.8 The major peaks related to low-grade glioma are proline/tyrosine (877, 852 cm\u20131) and choline/cholesterol (877 cm\u20131), while it was phenylalanine (1004, 1032 cm\u20131); tryptophan (1553, 1339 cm\u20131); amide III, collagen, and nucleic acid (1339 cm\u20131); and amide I, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acid (1659 cm\u20131) for high-grade glioma.9 The following peaks were the factors of differentiation between the two grades: C=O stretching (1858 cm\u20131), CH2 bending (1450 cm\u20131), amide III and CH2 deformation (1230\u20131360 cm\u20131), structural changes of phospholipid (1130 cm\u20131), and polysaccharides/amino acids (850 cm\u20131).10 The peak between 2889 and 2934 cm\u20131 (lipids and lipoproteins) had a lower intensity than the ones at 1667 cm\u20131 (collagen and amide) in cancer tissues and vice versa in normal tissues, which can be paved back to structural changes in tissue during the course of development into cancer where cell proliferation is high.11 It was also pinpointed by Iturrioz-Rodr\u00edguez et al. that the proliferation rate and mitochondrial content play a major role in cancer as the peaks of RNA/DNA and cytochrome C are increased in glioma cells.12 The usage of CARS images with GFP helps in finding the neoplastic tumor in a single cell level, making it more precise and giving an idea about the cellular changes in both ex vivo and in vivo glioma.70 Another similar study used CARS and TPEF images of 55 brain tumor lesions and overlaid them to give a highly resolute image comparable to that of the gold standard histology images.",

    "description": "Introduction\n      Raman Spectroscopy is one of those very\nfew techniques which is\nlabel-free (other major ones being NMR, XPS, UV\u2013vis, FTIR,\nmass spectroscopy), nondestructive, and cost-effective among those\nthat can give a molecular profile of the samples. Numerous research\ngroups are working on improving the conventionally used Raman instruments,\nintegrating them with other instruments to utilize as a multimodal\ntool, and changing/enhancing parameters to increase performance efficiency,\nportability, affordability, etc. This has led to various Raman spectroscopy\ntypes namely resonance Raman, surface-enhanced Raman (SERS), spatially\noffset Raman (SORS), confocal Raman microspectroscopy, etc. They have\nbeen used in various industries including forensics, pharma, food,\netc., especially in quality control. Raman being nondestructive is\nalso very well suited for biological sample analysis too. This potentiates\nits capability to act as a disease diagnostics and monitoring instrument.\nLately, they have been modified and integrated to be used in treatment\ntoo.\n      Raman Spectroscopy works based on the Raman effect where\nthe inelastic\nscattering of photons results in their movement from ground vibrational\nenergy states to virtual energy states and back. But if they stop\nat a higher or lower vibrational energy state than where they started,\nit is called Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman scattering, respectively.1 This when recorded for different samples varies\naccording to their composition which is digitally represented in the\nform of peaks based on the intensity and frequency variations observed,\nhelping in the identification of the sample composition. This helps\nRaman spectroscopy recognize and distinguish cell lines and tissue\nsamples both in vivo and ex vivo. Moreover, within these groups too,\nthey can classify based on the biochemical composition be it normal\nor tumorous, between different grades of cancer, etc.\n      Brain\ntumor is caused by the abnormal growth of cells in the brain\nregion. Still, why a person gets a brain tumor is not well established\nbut a few reasons for getting one include rare genetic conditions\nlike von Hippel-Lindau disease, tuberous sclerosis, etc. Brain tumor\nusually occurs in the meninges or glial cells. In most cases, a meningioma\ntumor in the meninges is benign, while glial cells called glioma can\nbe malignant. The tumors are classified into 4 grades with malignancy\nincreasing with each grade. Normally, the grade 1 tumors are benign,\nin gliomas too. Grade 2 can/cannot be benign, whereas grades 3 and\n4 are malignant. They are also categorized into primary and secondary\nbrain cancers based on the site of origin with cancers starting in\nthe brain itself considered to be primary and the brain metastases\nfrom other cancers as secondary.2\n      There were 308,102 new cases and 251,329 fatalities due to brain\nand CNS cancers worldwide in 2020, according to the GLOBOCAN 2020\nreport.3 Also, brain cancer has one of\nthe lowest 5% year survival rates among all other cancer types.4 These statistics and the complexity of brain\ntumors clearly signify the requirement for better diagnostics, monitoring,\nand treatment techniques. Here, Figure 1 shows the most followed histopathology process, while Figure 2 shows how Raman\nspectroscopy can, in comparison, be more helpful in all three scenarios\ndiscussed above. Thus, in this article, we will be reviewing the works\nwhich discuss the ability of Raman spectroscopy in the diagnosis,\nmonitoring, and treatment (surgery) of brain tumors.\n      \n        Figure 1\n        \n          Schematic representation\nof the long and tedious histopathology\nprocess. The patients need to undergo initial scanning to identify\nthe tumor. This is followed by a sample section which further undergoes\nmultiple processing steps taking longer time and needs to be confirmed\nby a neuropathologist which increases the chances of error. An error\nor partial removal of tumor leads to invasive surgery, again affecting\nthe health and quality of life of patient.

Analyzing of\nsamples via Raman revealed 19 new shifts which have not been reported\nbefore representing calcification (975 cm\u20131), collagen\n(817 cm\u20131), heme content (743 cm\u20131), glycogen (941 cm\u20131), lipids (431, 776, 875,\n968 cm\u20131), nucleic acids (498, 780, 825, 894 cm\u20131), and proteins (524, 933, 963, 1031, 1035, 1583,\n1603 cm\u20131) (represented in Table 1).7 Kopec et al.\nsuggested that the peaks obtained from aggressive brain tumors at\nwavenumbers 1004 cm\u20131 (proteins), 1156 and 1520\ncm\u20131 (carotenoids), 1585 cm\u20131 (cytochrome),\nand 1444 and 1655 cm\u20131 (fatty acids) are potential\nbiomarkers for oncological diagnosis.8 The\nmajor peaks related to low-grade glioma are proline/tyrosine (877,\n852 cm\u20131) and choline/cholesterol (877 cm\u20131), while it was phenylalanine (1004, 1032 cm\u20131);\ntryptophan (1553, 1339 cm\u20131); amide III, collagen,\nand nucleic acid (1339 cm\u20131); and amide I, proteins,\nlipids, and nucleic acid (1659 cm\u20131) for high-grade\nglioma.9 The following peaks were the factors\nof differentiation between the two grades: C=O stretching (1858\ncm\u20131), CH2 bending (1450 cm\u20131), amide III and CH2 deformation (1230\u20131360 cm\u20131), structural changes of phospholipid (1130 cm\u20131), and polysaccharides/amino acids (850 cm\u20131).10 The peak between 2889 and 2934 cm\u20131 (lipids and lipoproteins) had a lower intensity than\nthe ones at 1667 cm\u20131 (collagen and amide) in cancer\ntissues and vice versa in normal tissues, which can be paved back\nto structural changes in tissue during the course of development into\ncancer where cell proliferation is high.11 It was also pinpointed by Iturrioz-Rodr\u00edguez et al. that\nthe proliferation rate and mitochondrial content play a major role\nin cancer as the peaks of RNA/DNA and cytochrome C are increased in\nglioma cells.12\n      \n        Table 1\n        \n          Major

shift to 1228 cm\u20131 from 1270 cm\u20131. The ratios of Aproteins/lipids, I1586/1444, and I2930/2845, clearly higher in medulloblastoma tissue than that\nin normal ones, are clearly seen in Figure 3 establishing lower lipid content in cancer.\nThe average area containing lipid content in tumorous tissue was 24%,\nwhile it was 58% in normal tissues.13 An\nincrease in peak levels was significant in protein bands (2930 cm\u20131) of dense cancer cells. Also, the protein/lipid ratio\nsaw a spike in dense cancer cells compared to normal but was not the\nsame between infiltered and normal cells.5 Another study from the same group supports the previous literature\nshowing enhanced conformational changes from \u03b1-helix to \u03b2-sheets\non tumor progression and an increase in the lipid-to-protein ratio\nfrom 1.46 \u00b1 0.02 in medulloblastoma to 1.99 \u00b1 0.03 in normal\nbrain tissues.14\n      \n        Figure 3\n        \n          MRI, Raman image, and\nRaman spectra of normal brain tissues (a).\nRaman image and Raman spectra of medulloblastoma (b).

Iturrioz-Rodr\u00edguez and group collected samples\nfrom four male glioma patients and tried to use Raman spectroscopy\nfor differentiating the healthy astrocytes from the cancerous region,\nespecially determining the tumor margin properly. The outcome concludes\nthat the band ranging between 1000 and 1300 cm\u20131 is sufficient to predict cancer cells with an accuracy of 92.5%.12 In another study, a proof of concept was developed\nby Ralbovsky and colleagues for deep-ultraviolet Raman spectroscopy.\nDeep-UV could be a potential option against conventional Raman spectroscopy\ninvolving visible or IR spectra because of UV radiation\u2019s ability\nto absorb and excite at the same wavelengths, resulting in the enhanced\nresonance of Raman signals. In this work, they used a UV wavelength\nof 198 nm (deep-UV) against NOD-SCID mice having brain cancer inflicted\nwith breast cancer cells. The UV exposure was fixed at 120 J/cm2 following the guidelines of the International Commission\non Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).17\n        In a similar study, Raman spectroscopy was used to\ndiscriminate the glioblastoma, metastasis, and normal groups. The\ngroup used the ratio between the peaks 721 cm\u20131,\nthe symmetric C\u2013N stretch of choline, and 782 cm\u20131, the uracil/cytosine ring breathing of nucleotides, to arrive at\nthe sensitivity and specificity levels. It was inferred that the sensitivity\nand specificity levels remained above 85% in all three cases.18\n        The study by Zhou et al. revealed that\ncancer tissues showed a\nreduction in the intensity of the fatty acid-rich resonance Raman\n(RR) peak at 2885 cm\u20131 and the taller peak of the\nprotein band at 2931 cm\u20131 compared to 2885 cm\u20131 unlike in healthy normal tissues. Also, the peak\nshift from 1358 cm\u20131 in low-grade glioma to 1378\ncm\u20131 in high-grade glioma discloses the domination\nof deoxy-hemoglobin in low and oxy-hemoglobin in high-grade glioma,\nthereby helping in hypoxia and necrosis monitoring. Also, the shift\nin peaks of amide I and amide III in normal and grade IV glioma tissue\nsuggests a structural conformation change from \u03b1-helix to \u03b2\nsheets. The predicted reason for the change is the mutation of tryptophan\nW104. The team used a confocal micro-Raman spectrometer with an excitation\nwavelength of 532 nm, taking 510 RR spectra from over 121 subjects,\nand the results were also compared with the results of the histopathological\nexamination which is the WHO gold standard.19\n        Till now, the predominant way of interpreting Raman signals\nbetween\nnormal and cancer tissues is by their peak intensity and shift in\nwavenumbers. In this study, Kaushik et al. studied the full width\nat half-maximum (fwhm) values to diagnose cancer based on the analogy\nin semiconductors that the most sensitive parameter of Raman spectra\nis the subtle variation of width confirmed by the effect of acceptor\u2013donor\ninteractions and quantum size. The hypothesis was established by the\nfact that the team found a decrease in fwhm from 8 to 5 cm\u20131 (37%) that was seen in brain cancer samples against the normal ones\nat 1001 cm\u20131 (protein). Similar results were also\nobtained for 1349 cm\u20131 (nucleic acid) and 1379 cm \u20131 (lipids). They showed a 13.8% increase and a 2% decrease,\nrespectively.20\n        Apart from chemometrics,\nthere are a lot of parameters in terms\nof the Raman spectroscopy instrument which can be optimized to get\nbetter diagnosis.21 A study on one such\nparameter was conducted by Leblond and group. They varied spectra\nintensity qualitatively (visual) and quantitative quality factors\nclassifying spectra into low and high. These low and high intensity\nspectra were applied on 44 brain cancer patients using a hand-held\nRaman probe. The results after chemometrics studies showed an increase\nof 20% sensitivity and 12% specificity in high spectral images to\nthat of its counterpart.22\n      \n      \n        3.2\n        Liquid Sample\n        A biosensor was developed\nby Malsagova and team to check the prediction capacity of Raman for\nbrain cancer from human plasma samples. The \u201csilicon-on-insulator\u201d\n(SOI) nanowires (NW) they created were surface-modified with an analog\nof miRNA-363 (a brain cancer marker). These were tested in a buffer\nsolution to know the maximum efficiency of the developed system and\nto have an initial quantity to proceed with for the plasma samples.\nThe system used for plasma samples was surface-modified with miRNA-363\nitself. Overall, the sensor was sensitive, starting from a concentration\nlevel of 3.3 \u00d7 10\u201317 M.23\n3.1\n        Solid Tissue Sample\n        Raman spectroscopy\ndue to its ability to identify the biochemical changes precisely can\nbe an excellent tool to diagnose cancer and all its subtypes with\nhigh accuracy.

The outcome concludes\nthat the band ranging between 1000 and 1300 cm\u20131 is sufficient to predict cancer cells with an accuracy of 92.5%.12 In another study, a proof of concept was developed\nby Ralbovsky and colleagues for deep-ultraviolet Raman spectroscopy.\nDeep-UV could be a potential option against conventional Raman spectroscopy\ninvolving visible or IR spectra because of UV radiation\u2019s ability\nto absorb and excite at the same wavelengths, resulting in the enhanced\nresonance of Raman signals. In this work, they used a UV wavelength\nof 198 nm (deep-UV) against NOD-SCID mice having brain cancer inflicted\nwith breast cancer cells. The UV exposure was fixed at 120 J/cm2 following the guidelines of the International Commission\non Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).17\n        In a similar study, Raman spectroscopy was used to\ndiscriminate the glioblastoma, metastasis, and normal groups. The\ngroup used the ratio between the peaks 721 cm\u20131,\nthe symmetric C\u2013N stretch of choline, and 782 cm\u20131, the uracil/cytosine ring breathing of nucleotides, to arrive at\nthe sensitivity and specificity levels. It was inferred that the sensitivity\nand specificity levels remained above 85% in all three cases.18\n        The study by Zhou et al. revealed that\ncancer tissues showed a\nreduction in the intensity of the fatty acid-rich resonance Raman\n(RR) peak at 2885 cm\u20131 and the taller peak of the\nprotein band at 2931 cm\u20131 compared to 2885 cm\u20131 unlike in healthy normal tissues. Also, the peak\nshift from 1358 cm\u20131 in low-grade glioma to 1378\ncm\u20131 in high-grade glioma discloses the domination\nof deoxy-hemoglobin in low and oxy-hemoglobin in high-grade glioma,\nthereby helping in hypoxia and necrosis monitoring. Also, the shift\nin peaks of amide I and amide III in normal and grade IV glioma tissue\nsuggests a structural conformation change from \u03b1-helix to \u03b2\nsheets. The predicted reason for the change is the mutation of tryptophan\nW104. The team used a confocal micro-Raman spectrometer with an excitation\nwavelength of 532 nm, taking 510 RR spectra from over 121 subjects,\nand the results were also compared with the results of the histopathological\nexamination which is the WHO gold standard.19\n        Till now, the predominant way of interpreting Raman signals\nbetween\nnormal and cancer tissues is by their peak intensity and shift in\nwavenumbers. In this study, Kaushik et al. studied the full width\nat half-maximum (fwhm) values to diagnose cancer based on the analogy\nin semiconductors that the most sensitive parameter of Raman spectra\nis the subtle variation of width confirmed by the effect of acceptor\u2013donor\ninteractions and quantum size. The hypothesis was established by the\nfact that the team found a decrease in fwhm from 8 to 5 cm\u20131 (37%) that was seen in brain cancer samples against the normal ones\nat 1001 cm\u20131 (protein). Similar results were also\nobtained for 1349 cm\u20131 (nucleic acid) and 1379 cm \u20131 (lipids). They showed a 13.8% increase and a 2% decrease,\nrespectively.20\n        Apart from chemometrics,\nthere are a lot of parameters in terms\nof the Raman spectroscopy instrument which can be optimized to get\nbetter diagnosis.21 A study on one such\nparameter was conducted by Leblond and group. They varied spectra\nintensity qualitatively (visual) and quantitative quality factors\nclassifying spectra into low and high. These low and high intensity\nspectra were applied on 44 brain cancer patients using a hand-held\nRaman probe. The results after chemometrics studies showed an increase\nof 20% sensitivity and 12% specificity in high spectral images to\nthat of its counterpart.22\n3.2\n        Liquid Sample\n        A biosensor was developed\nby Malsagova and team to check the prediction capacity of Raman for\nbrain cancer from human plasma samples. The \u201csilicon-on-insulator\u201d\n(SOI) nanowires (NW) they created were surface-modified with an analog\nof miRNA-363 (a brain cancer marker). These were tested in a buffer\nsolution to know the maximum efficiency of the developed system and\nto have an initial quantity to proceed with for the plasma samples.\nThe system used for plasma samples was surface-modified with miRNA-363\nitself. Overall, the sensor was sensitive, starting from a concentration\nlevel of 3.3 \u00d7 10\u201317 M.23\n4\n      Raman Spectroscopy in Monitoring\n      This\nunique study used Raman spectroscopy to monitor responses\nof T-cells and monocytes in tumor-conditioned media of glioblastoma\nby introducing CD73 and EMT activator ZEB1, regulators of cancer cell\nimmunogenicity. The results were analyzed using multivariate analysis\ntools, PCA for unsupervised and LDA and SVM for supervised analysis.\nThe results obtained were matched with that of flow cytometry. Both\nresults indicated similar changes in the immunomarkers. The major\nchanges were seen in CD209, CD64, CD4, CD8, and CD11c. From the results,\nit can be interpreted that T-cells and monocytes are influenced and\nare differentiated into mixed populations of anti- and pro-tumorogenic\nmacrophages and dendritic cells by ZEB1 and CD73, respectively.24\n      Surmacki studied the effects of \u03b3\nradiation on Daoy cells\n(medulloblastoma) by both labeled (oxidative stress and metabolic\nactivity) and label-free (Raman spectroscopy) methods. The work uses\ntherapeutic doses of irradiation of 2 Gy and 10 Gy. The spectral analysis\nindicated the degradation of proteins and membranes after treatment\nwith 2 Gy \u03b3 radiation. Further, data analysis shows an average\nsensitivity and specificity of 80.35% and 79.65%, respectively. Thus,\nthis combination of Raman spectroscopy along with other histological\ntechniques can be used as a monitoring tool for radiation-treated\nmedulloblastoma patients in the future after deeper study on the same.25\n      Raman spectroscopy will be used more often\nin the case of monitoring\nthan diagnosis or treatment. SORS with optimal offset values would\nbe a great choice as they can capture the signals inside the skull\nfrom outside, thereby contributing to the patient\u2019s good by\nmaintaining noninvasiveness.\n5\n      Raman Spectroscopy in Surgery\n      A Raman\nimaging study carried out over a period of 1.5 years in\n209 patients with different types of brain cancer was able to identify\nrecurring glioblastoma with 100%, primary with 94% and glioma metastases\nwith 90% accuracy. Similarly, for oligodendroglioma, astrocytes, and\ntheir IDH1 mutant versions, the accuracies stood at 90%, 86%, and\n81%, respectively.26 Another work by Livermore\nand group studies the ability of Raman to classify brain cancer based\non their genetic subtypes. This experiment was from fresh samples\ncollected from 62 patients having IDH wildtype and IDH mutated astrocytoma\nand oligodendroglioma. Apart from these, the group also has cryosectioned,\nFFPE, and LN-18 (IDH-wildtype and mutated parental) glioma cell lines.\nThe results of all these samples were further authenticated by genetic\nsequencing and immunohistochemistry. Quantitatively, the sensitivity\nand specificity for predicting among the 3 tissue types were 79\u201394%\nand 90\u2013100%, respectively. The overall time for all types of\nclassification and prediction was within 15 min per sample.27 Uckermann and team explored the feasibility\nof using Raman Spectroscopy for identifying IDH1 mutation glioma tissue\nsamples. Overall, there was a surge in DNA-related spectral bands\nwhile that of lipids decreased. Also, variations in spectral bands\ncorresponding to protein were seen between IDH1 wild type and IDH1\nmutant gliomas. The classification was finally done only based on\n5 bands (498, 826, 1003, 1174, and 1337 cm\u20131) and\nthe accuracy was 89%.15\n      Auner et\nal. analyzed 64 samples either fresh or frozen from 28\npediatric patients to differentiate between tumors and their grades.\nThe tissues had accuracy levels above 90%, while their differential\nsensitivity and specificities for low and high-grade ependymomas were\n100% and 96% and between normal and low-grade glioma it was 91.5%\nand 97.8%, respectively.28 The same team\npublished the results of a comprehensive 6-year study on pediatric\npatients with solid tumors. The work used Raman to detect brain tumors\namong other types. A training set based on PCA-DFA gave 95.1% accuracy,\nwhile the testing group gave 88.9%. The team also tested the algorithm\nin a generalized database and found 85.5% accuracy in spotting brain\ncancer. The histopathology verifications were performed by pediatric\npathology specialists.29 One more team\nalso worked on pediatric patients. In their work, ex vivo brain tissues\nof 29 pediatric patients were imaged using Raman. The images were\ntrained via machine learning algorithms to discriminate between normal\nand tumorous brain tissues and between normal and low-grade glioma\n(LGG). The accuracy was achieved at around 85% in both cases.30\n      A label-free in situ intraoperative cancer\ndetection system based\non high wavenumber (2000 to 4000 cm\u20131) Raman spectroscopy\nwas developed by Leblond and team for the detection and biopsy of\nbrain cancer. They validated the integrated core needle biopsy system\nwith an animal study on swine. Further, a human clinical trial was\nalso conducted on 19 patients to identify the capacity of the newly\ndevised HWN RS to decide between normal and cancerous brain tissues.\nThe tissues were classified into dense (>60%), infiltered (5\u201360%),\nand normal (<5% or no) cancer cells to check the tumor border too\nas shown in Figure 4.5 Fifty-nine patients, 223 tissue samples,\nand 1273 spectra were obtained to differentiate meningioma and dura\nmater using Raman spectroscopy. They were analyzed with the help of\na machine learning-based classifier which gave about 100% and 93.97%\nin the external set while the internal 5-fold cross-validation set\ngave 96.06 \u00b1 0.03% and 95.44 \u00b1 0.02% sensitivity and specificity,\nrespectively. The study used the tissue samples obtained intraoperatively\nwithout any preprocessing and were measured using Raman spectroscopy\nwithin 20 min of excision to match the in vivo sample condition as\nmuch as possible. Though the sensitivity is obtained to be 100% from\nthe classifier, single spot measurements cannot be used for diagnosis\nas in areas of infiltration the tumor margin in the tissue varies\nfrom point-to-point necessitating the need for more spectra.31\n      \n        Figure 4\n        \n          Raman spectra of normal, infiltrated, and cancer tissues\n(a).

Cancer spectra (blue) in panel (a) distinctly shows a peak between\n2845 and 2885 cm\u20131, representing its low lipid content\nin line with the literature studies which impart that a high protein\nto lipid ratio represents the presence of cancer. Here in panel (b)\nit is validated with the H&E staining where the cancer image is\nhighly stained.5 Reprinted with permission\nfrom ref (5). Copyright\n2018 Nature.\n        \n        \n      \n      The feature engineering approach opted for by Leblond\net al. analyses\na data set of 547 spectra based on about 30 parameters through a Bayesian\nframework. This comprehensive molecular profiling infers plausible\nchanges noticed in glioma like a nucleic acid increase, collagen IV\noverexpression, and a shift in the spectra of peaks involved in primary\nmetabolism.9 A feature-driven Raman analysis\nwas established by Stables and colleagues to ease and improve the\nreal-time intraoperative use of Raman spectroscopy. They mapped the\nsub-band spectra with a frequency modulator (FM) to provide the output\nas sound signals varying for normal and disease conditions. Then participants\nwere asked to predict based on listening tests. The classification\naccuracy was 71.1%, though feature extraction by SVM output was 88.99%.\nThe parameters like hearing sensitivity and effects due to age and\nsex would also have significantly contributed to the results. Still,\nimprovement in the sonification parameter might give better results.32\n      Straehle et al. interpreted ex vivo brain\ntumor samples via stimulated\nRaman histology (SRH) with the help of a novice neuropathologist to\ndetermine the accuracy and comprehensibility of SRH. The results were\nalso compared with the same section\u2019s hematoxylin-eosin (H&E)\nstaining results. In terms of accuracy, SRH did not have a significant\nimpact but was not inferior to that of the H&E stained sections\nas their accuracy stood at 87.3% against 88.9%, respectively. The\nability of SRH images to highlight putative axons, tumoral, and glial\nfibers unlike in H&E staining talks about its comprehensiveness.33 Also, the SRH can be used as an intraoperative\ntechnique during surgeries as a parallel tool to that of the conventional\ndue to their time-saving ability and easy processing of data due to\ntheir digital nature.34 Another study by\nPekmezci and the group also showed similar results between SRH and\nH&E stained sections. The results were noninferior as both SRH\nand H&E stained groups confirmed only around half the samples\nfor glioma infiltration at the tumor margin, while immunohistochemistry\nresults were comparatively more significant than the other two.35\n      Odion and group explored the ability of\nSESORS in three different\nsystems and offset values namely 4 mm in paraffin film and tissue\nphantom and 5 mm in a Macaque monkey skull. The system used for surface\nenhancement was a Gold nanostar with PEG and Raman active dyes. The\ngroup came up with a two-layer phantom setup that can give clean spectra\nby scaled subtraction. The top layer of the setup had DTTC-labeled\nnanostars while the bottom had Cy-7 labeled nanostars. After this,\nthey went one step ahead to rectify the limitations in SESORS in terms\nof penetration of the skull, that too with good intensity. Further,\nas the penetration was to be through bone, which usually overwhelms\nunderlying signals because of the phosphate groups, the authors used\nan axicon lens which has better area coverage with a better permissive\nlaser. This modified setup was called inverse SESORS. This shows the\npotential of the novel system to be used in enhanced noninvasive brain\ncancer detection studies.36\n      An earlier\nstudy was also on similar lines. Moody and co-workers\nchecked the potential of SESORS to noninvasively detect neurotransmitters\ninside the skull region from outside. The animal model they opted\nfor was a cat skull as it has a skull thickness of 2 mm (humans: 3\u201314\nmm), thus making the offset value to be 2 mm. They used Au as the\nsurface-enhancing agent and coated it with neurotransmitters. These\nneurotransmitters namely serotonin, melatonin, and epinephrine were\ndetected by SESORS at a minimum concentration of 100 \u03bcM.38 Nicolson and colleagues developed a (SESO(R)RS),\n\u201csurface enhanced spatially offset resonance Raman spectroscopy\u201d,\nto study glioblastoma in a noninvasive method. In this study, the\ngroup did in vivo imaging of deep-seated GBM in mice through the intact\nskull. They developed their own spatially offset Raman spectroscopy\n(SORS) system, integrated with the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy\n(SERS). The surface enhancement involved was a gold nanostar and a\nRaman-reporter dye system functionalized with cRGDyK peptide, as seen\nin Figure 5. The SORS\nwas initially compared with conventional Raman spectroscopy against\na PTFE phantom at 2 mm and 3 mm spatial offset while the SESO(R)RS\nsystem had an offset of 2.5 mm. This was not optimized further as\nthe aim of the study was to visualize and interpret SESO(R)RS in Glioblastoma\nnoninvasively.37\n      \n        Figure 5\n        \n          Surface-enhanced resonance\nRaman Spectroscopy (SERRS) system.

The results do not support the widely accepted Warburg mechanism\nfor cancer but oxidative phosphorylation. Though they are the mechanism\nof action for normal cells, in cancer cells, there is an increased\nconcentration of cytochrome c to regulate bioenergetics via ATP and\nalso enhance denovo lipid synthesis. In conclusion, the team recommends\nRaman spectroscopy to continuously examine the redox state changes\nin the mitochondrial cytochrome and thereby malignancy of brain tumors.39 Zhou and colleagues studied glioma in 21 specimens\nusing confocal Raman microspectroscopy in the visible range and found\ntwo new peaks increasing in intensity with increasing grade of glioma.\nOne at 1129 cm\u20131 is attributed to phosphatidic acid,\nan unsaturated fatty acid, or lactic acid, which plays an important\nrole in glycolysis and 1338 cm\u20131 to adenosine triphosphate\n(ATP). Both contribute to characteristic effects in the metabolism\nof cancer, especially the Warburg effect hypothesis,40 contradictory to ref (39).\n      The work involves the use of Raman Spectroscopy\nto compare, analyze,\nand understand Glioma-like stem cells that are either radiation resistant\nor intermediate or sensitive based on their IC50 values. The results\ndemonstrated high intensities for nucleic acid bands. This was attributed\nto the higher proliferation rates seen in neurospheres in the order\nof resistant > intermediate > sensitive, appropriately affirming\nprevious\nliterature.41 Additionally, the glycogen\nand cholesterol levels were low in cancerous groups when compared\nto normal. The quantitative data were analyzed using CDA and then\nwere measured in MGG23, MGG4, and SK1035 neurospheres. These were\nmatched with their results in a clonogenic assay, and a minimum of\n95% accuracy was obtained. The group also treated the GSCs with drugs\nlike 2-DG, ZOL, and HC-3 and checked their Raman spectral bands to\nlearn about their drug efficiency in treating cancer.42\n      A compilation of the

Raman Spectroscopy\n      An intraoperative\nstudy comparing the use of 5-ALA-induced fluorescence-driven\nsurgery and the possibility of replacing it with Raman was explored.\nWith 5-ALA fluorescence-guided surgery, surgeons can switch from white\nlight to blue light with a click of a button which is not possible\nif Raman spectroscopy is integrated into surgery. But 5-ALA fails\nin terms of successfully representing the tumor margins, whereas Raman\nspectroscopy manages to be efficient both at the core and margin of\nthe tumor tissue and obvious with the normal tissues. Clearly, the\nRaman results upheld the previous literature as peaks of lipids (825,\n853, 1087, 1124, and 1305 cm\u20131) and DNA (517, 885,\n1206, and 1342 cm\u20131) are dominant in glioma groups,\nwhile amino acids (540, 615, 635, and 649 cm\u20131)\nand amide III protein (1522 and 1553 cm\u20131) peaks\nare dominant in normal brain tissues. Thus, the authors conclude by\nsuggesting the combined multimodal use of both 5-ALA fluorescence\nand Raman spectroscopy to target cancer tissues in vivo.46 Another intraoperative study by Jermyn and group\ninvestigated the detection ability of Raman beyond the preoperative\nMRI detection levels. Their results supported Rahman\u2019s discrimination\ncapacity as it was able to discern low-density cancer 1.5 cm beyond\nthe MRI levels.56 The same team, in another\nsimilar work, compared the better of MRI and Raman imaging for cancer\ndetection in depth with specifics. It was found that Raman outperformed\nT1-contrast enhanced MRI and T2-weighted MRI by detecting invasive\ncancer cells to a maximum of 3.7 and 2.4 cm beyond T1 and T2 levels,\nrespectively. Also, Raman spectroscopy was able to find as small as\n6 invasive cancer cells for each 0.0625 mm2.63\n      Gajjar proposes the complementary use\nof both FTIR and Raman for\nbrain tumor diagnosis as they observed 1045 to 1545 cm\u20131 (phosphate to carbohydrate) changes in high-grade gliomas and alteration\nin 1121 to 1020 cm\u20131 (RNA to DNA) ratio in meningioma,\nonly with FTIR. Similarly, changes in the 1670 to 1001 cm\u20131 (cholesterol to phenylalanine) ratio to discriminate low-grade astrocytoma\nfrom meningioma were observed only in Raman.64 But another similar study by Depciuch and colleagues comparing tumorous\nand nontumorous brain tissues is profiled based on their molecular\nchanges in FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. The findings infer major changes\nin the sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine levels when analyzed\nvia Raman. On the other hand, FTIR only on Kramers\u2013Kronig transformation\nwas able to identify changes in 1450, 2847, and 2915 cm\u20131, all belonging to lipid vibrations, but the same was more comprehensive\nin Raman.65\n      Combined spatial frequency\nand resonance Raman spectroscopy was\ndeveloped by Zhou et al. to distinguish between brain metastases and\nnormal brain tissues. The SFS\u2019s dominant amplitude moved away\nfrom the center in all directions, indicating low spatial frequency\nin the center and vice versa. The higher frequency low amplitude system\nprevailed majorly in cancerous tissues contrasting to normal tissues.\nThe RR spectra results revealed the significant intensity augmentation\nof lactate, tryptophan, and amide II. The carotene peaks were either\nconstant or moved to a higher frequency in metastases tissues. These\nresults on further interpretation with SVM showcased reliable similarity\nwith the gold standard \u201chistopathology\u201d.61\n7\n      Nonlinear Raman Spectroscopy\n      In general,\nnonlinear Raman spectroscopy involves more than one\nlaser source, and the Raman signal is independent of incident light\nintensity unlike in conventional, linear Raman spectroscopy. The interaction\nof the energy from different laser sources, usually a pump beam and\nstokes beam, enables a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and resolution\nmagnitude compared to spontaneous Raman spectroscopy. Widely used\nnonlinear Raman spectroscopy techniques are coherent anti-Stokes Raman\nspectroscopy (CARS) and stimulated Raman spectroscopy (SRS).\n      \n        7.1\n        Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS)\n        Uckermann with his team explored the ability of CARS to delineate\nglioblastoma, brain metastases of breast cancer, and melanoma in a\nmouse model. The CH-tuned CARS setup showed lower intensity in their\nsignals, unlike normal tissues because lipid content is lower in tumor\nconditions. The intensity of reduction was not as significant in metastases\nas that of glioblastoma. This was attributed to the primary brain\ncancer characteristic in GBM compared to the metastases of melanoma\nand breast cancer, thereby helping in the discernment and diagnosis.66 Pohling et al. mapped the tumor region in a\nmouse brain tissue using multiplex-CARS. The infiltration region was\ndetected by SVM. Unlike most other works, which color codes based\non spectral intensity, this study color-coded based on pathological\ninformation. The final output was checked with the reference H&E\nstained samples and was found to be in-line with them.67 A study by Galli and group investigated the\neffect of tissue fixation methods on CARS images and tissue biochemistry.\nThe results revealed that fixing using methanol-acetone lowers the\nlipid content making it incompatible for CARS, while formalin did\nnot alter the biochemistry much nor the contrast and intensity of\nthe images obtained.68\n        Most CARS\nstudies are done with a multimodal approach. A novel multimodal photon\nmicroscopy using nonlinear imaging was put forth by Meyer and team\nto replace or complement the current gold standard \u201chistopathology\u201d.\nThe multimodal setup involves coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy\n(CARS), second harmonic generation (SHG), and two photon-excited fluorescence\nmicroscopy (TPEF). Only the aliphatic CH2 band is used\nby CARS to discern tumor and normal tissue, while SHG gives high chemical\nselectivity, especially to the blood vessels, arachnoid membrane,\nand other components rich in collagen. On the other hand, TPEF helps\nin imaging morphology of the tissue label-free. The results combined\noverall were also verified with FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. This\ncompleted setup managed to produce similar results to that of H&E\nstaining but only on a large scale. At a single-cell level, the latter\nwas superior.69 Study by Galli et al. involved\ngreen fluoroscence protein (GFP) tagged to glioma cells and 5-ALA\nfor targeting glioma both used by TPEF and CARS, respectively, to\ndemonstrate the identification of infiltrated brain tumors in both\nhuman and mouse models. The usage of CARS images with GFP helps in\nfinding the neoplastic tumor in a single cell level, making it more\nprecise and giving an idea about the cellular changes in both ex vivo\nand in vivo glioma.70 Another similar study\nused CARS and TPEF images of 55 brain tumor lesions and overlaid them\nto give a highly resolute image comparable to that of the gold standard\nhistology images. The CARS system used a 670 nm laser as its pump\nbeam and a 830 nm Ti:Sa beam at its Stoke\u2019s beam source. These\nwere recombined spatially and temporally to come up with the CARS\nimages. Thus, the images obtained can guide neurosurgeons to avoid\nbrain hemorrhage as the images were able to represent even the blood\nvessels while also saving time for neuropathologists to identify section\nregions minimizing the invasiveness of the surgery.71 One more study by Uckermann et al. utilized CARS and TPEF\ncombination to classify between brain tumor, its subtypes, brain metastases\nof other solid tumors, and nontumors. Samples were obtained from 382\npatients and 28 nontumor brain samples. The texture analysis done\nusing CARS was further analyzed with LDA. The developed system was\nable to identify all nontumors with 100% accuracy, while the overall\ncorrect rate stood at 96%. Forty-two samples were analyzed in a fresh\nstate to test the system\u2019s ability to translate to the clinic.\nAlso, the setup was able to classify tumors even with an image resolution\nof 1 \u03bcm.72\n      \n      \n        7.2\n        Stimulated Raman Scattering Spectroscopy (SRS)\n        Ji et al. tapped the potential of SRS to discriminate between neoplastic\nand non-neoplastic in both ex vivo and in vivo mouse models. The team\nused a tunable pump beam of 600 to 1000 nm from an optical parametric\noscillator and a Stoke\u2019s beam of 1064 nm over the sample. The\nenergy difference between the two beams was matched with the molecular\nvibrations to induct SRS. The results acquired through SRS were matched\nwith that of H&E staining, and a Cohen\u2019s \u03ba value\nof 0.98 was obtained, implying an approximate 98% match.73 The SRS imaging system integrated with multivariate\ncurve resolution (MCR) and quadratic SVM was utilized by Bae and colleagues\nto virtually do the H&E staining in glioblastoma specimens and\nfurther subtype classification, where illustration of the same is\nseen in Figure 6. Apart\nfrom visualizing the vascular proliferation and demyelination progress,\nthe setup was able to signify the intratumoral heterogeneity to a\ncertain extent.74 One study employed fiber-laser-based\nSRS for histology. The aim of the study was to explore the competence\nof SRS to identify the tumor attained from the infiltrate tumor margins\nof brain tissue samples. The stimulated Raman histology (SRH) and\nH&E stained samples with a residual tumor were identified properly\nin 49% of the samples, while the same for immunohistochemistry (IHC)\nwas 56%. The observations were done by three neuropathologists in\na blinded manner.35 In another work by\nJi et al., fresh, unprocessed samples from 22 brain cancer patients\nwas obtained to detect the tumor infiltration. The team exercised\nquasi-likelihood strategy to develop a generalized additive model\n(GAM) exploiting 1477 field of view (FOV) images from 3 epilepsy and\n15 brain cancer patients. Half the set of images were used to train\nthe model, while the remaining were used to test it. Due to SRS\u2019s\nproficiency to recognize the histoarchitectural structures, axonal,\nand cellular densities unlike other Raman systems, they were inculcated\nin the classifier to improve the result leading to a specificity of\n98.5% and sensitivity of 97.5% and also a \u03ba = 0.86 against the\nH&E stained light microscopy.75\n        \n          Figure 6\n          \n            Graphical representation\nof SRS imaging diagnostic platform for\nrapid glioblastoma subtyping. Here, the image stack denotes the tissue\narea obtained under an SRS microscope. Each tile of the stack undergoes\nmultivariate curve analysis to express the major spectral components.\nAmong those components, the decomposed spectra are used for subtyping\nglioblastoma while reconstructed concentration maps are merged to\ngive histological images.74 Reprinted from\nref (74). Copyright\n2021 American Chemical Society.\n          \n          \n        \n        A multimodal SRS-SOCT (spectroscopic optical coherence\ntomography)\nsetup was exploited by Soltani and group to assess its capability\nto distinguish between a normal and tumorous brain in a 9 L gliosarcoma\nrat model. It was found from the work that SOCT can resolve spatial\nand spectral features of the SRS comparatively easily which leads\nto faster data acquisition of even larger regions, which makes the\nmultimodal setup a good option to consider for clinical use.76 Orringer et al. were the first ones to come\nup with a SRS microscopy for intraoperative use in the clinic and\nalso SRH, virtual H&E staining. The virtual stained images were\nobtained with 2 s per frame FOV in a mosaic pattern, stitched, and\nrecolored, taking only 2.5 min for a whole mosaic. The instrumental\nsetup consisted of a portable fiber-laser-based microscopy integrated\nwith the SRS. Samples from 101 brain tumor patients were considered\nfor the study, with half done via frozen sectioning and the remaining\nvia SRH. The portable setup showed a 25-fold enhanced SNR. The inter-rater\nreliability [Cohen\u2019s kappa (\u03ba)] consistently remained\nabove 0.89 in all cases whether it be distinguishing between glial\nand nonglial, SRH and H&E staining, or lesional and nonlesional\nwith an accuracy of above 90%.77\n7.1\n        Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS)\n        Uckermann with his team explored the ability of CARS to delineate\nglioblastoma, brain metastases of breast cancer, and melanoma in a\nmouse model.

Thus, the images obtained can guide neurosurgeons to avoid\nbrain hemorrhage as the images were able to represent even the blood\nvessels while also saving time for neuropathologists to identify section\nregions minimizing the invasiveness of the surgery.71 One more study by Uckermann et al. utilized CARS and TPEF\ncombination to classify between brain tumor, its subtypes, brain metastases\nof other solid tumors, and nontumors. Samples were obtained from 382\npatients and 28 nontumor brain samples. The texture analysis done\nusing CARS was further analyzed with LDA. The developed system was\nable to identify all nontumors with 100% accuracy, while the overall\ncorrect rate stood at 96%. Forty-two samples were analyzed in a fresh\nstate to test the system\u2019s ability to translate to the clinic.\nAlso, the setup was able to classify tumors even with an image resolution\nof 1 \u03bcm.72\n7.2\n        Stimulated Raman Scattering Spectroscopy (SRS)\n        Ji et al. tapped the potential of SRS to discriminate between neoplastic\nand non-neoplastic in both ex vivo and in vivo mouse models. The team\nused a tunable pump beam of 600 to 1000 nm from an optical parametric\noscillator and a Stoke\u2019s beam of 1064 nm over the sample. The\nenergy difference between the two beams was matched with the molecular\nvibrations to induct SRS. The results acquired through SRS were matched\nwith that of H&E staining, and a Cohen\u2019s \u03ba value\nof 0.98 was obtained, implying an approximate 98% match.73 The SRS imaging system integrated with multivariate\ncurve resolution (MCR) and quadratic SVM was utilized by Bae and colleagues\nto virtually do the H&E staining in glioblastoma specimens and\nfurther subtype classification, where illustration of the same is\nseen in Figure 6. Apart\nfrom visualizing the vascular proliferation and demyelination progress,\nthe setup was able to signify the intratumoral heterogeneity to a\ncertain extent.74 One study employed fiber-laser-based\nSRS for histology. The aim of the study was to explore the competence\nof SRS to identify the tumor attained from the infiltrate tumor margins\nof brain tissue samples. The stimulated Raman histology (SRH) and\nH&E stained samples with a residual tumor were identified properly\nin 49% of the samples, while the same for immunohistochemistry (IHC)\nwas 56%. The observations were done by three neuropathologists in\na blinded manner.35 In another work by\nJi et al., fresh, unprocessed samples from 22 brain cancer patients\nwas obtained to detect the tumor infiltration. The team exercised\nquasi-likelihood strategy to develop a generalized additive model\n(GAM) exploiting 1477 field of view (FOV) images from 3 epilepsy and\n15 brain cancer patients. Half the set of images were used to train\nthe model, while the remaining were used to test it. Due to SRS\u2019s\nproficiency to recognize the histoarchitectural structures, axonal,\nand cellular densities unlike other Raman systems, they were inculcated\nin the classifier to improve the result leading to a specificity of\n98.5% and sensitivity of 97.5% and also a \u03ba = 0.86 against the\nH&E stained light microscopy.75\n        \n          Figure 6\n          \n            Graphical representation\nof SRS imaging diagnostic platform for\nrapid glioblastoma subtyping. Here, the image stack denotes the tissue\narea obtained under an SRS microscope. Each tile of the stack undergoes\nmultivariate curve analysis to express the major spectral components.\nAmong those components, the decomposed spectra are used for subtyping\nglioblastoma while reconstructed concentration maps are merged to\ngive histological images.74 Reprinted from\nref (74). Copyright\n2021 American Chemical Society.\n          \n          \n        \n        A multimodal SRS-SOCT (spectroscopic optical coherence\ntomography)\nsetup was exploited by Soltani and group to assess its capability\nto distinguish between a normal and tumorous brain in a 9 L gliosarcoma\nrat model. It was found from the work that SOCT can resolve spatial\nand spectral features of the SRS comparatively easily which leads\nto faster data acquisition of even larger regions, which makes the\nmultimodal setup a good option to consider for clinical use.76 Orringer et al. were the first ones to come\nup with a SRS microscopy for intraoperative use in the clinic and\nalso SRH, virtual H&E staining. The virtual stained images were\nobtained with 2 s per frame FOV in a mosaic pattern, stitched, and\nrecolored, taking only 2.5 min for a whole mosaic. The instrumental\nsetup consisted of a portable fiber-laser-based microscopy integrated\nwith the SRS. Samples from 101 brain tumor patients were considered\nfor the study, with half done via frozen sectioning and the remaining\nvia SRH. The portable setup showed a 25-fold enhanced SNR. The inter-rater\nreliability [Cohen\u2019s kappa (\u03ba)] consistently remained\nabove 0.89 in all cases whether it be distinguishing between glial\nand nonglial, SRH and H&E staining, or lesional and nonlesional\nwith an accuracy of above 90%.77\n8\n      Chemometrics\n      Aguiar et al. imaged 263\nspectra of various brain tissues both\ntumorous and nontumorous and analyzed 16 biochemical compounds by\nusing a least-squares fitting spectral model. The discriminant models\nused were LDA and PLS-DA. The accuracies for separating normal and\ntumor models were 93.3% and 94.1%, respectively, which are approximately\nthe same. This suggests the use of any one of the models for discrimination\nanalysis in the future.48 The aim of the\nstudy was to discriminate between grades I and II meningiomas via\nRaman microspectroscopy with utmost accuracy. For the same, the team\ninvestigated 90 meningioma samples and the biochemical changes were\nanalyzed with multiple chemometric methodologies. Among them, SPA-QDA\nand PCA-QDA showed higher accuracy values of about 96.2% with sensitivities\nand specificities at 85.7% and 100%, respectively.10 Lilo and team collected 95 meningioma tissue samples from\ngrades I and II combined. The samples were analyzed using Raman hyperspectral\nimaging and processed by 3D-PCA-QDA. The results of postprocessing\nshowed 96% accuracy with 95% specificity and 100% sensitivity.78\n      Chen and colleagues used different computational\nalgorithms to\nfind the most accurate prediction among convolutional neural networks\n(CNN), recursive neural networks (RNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP),\nand AlexNet for binary classification between control groups and glioma\nand glioma and lung cancer using 5-fold cross-validation. AlexNet\u2019s\naccuracy stood out at 100% and 95.2%, respectively, making it the\nbest algorithm among the ones used.49 Jermyn\net al. used artificial neural networks to accommodate the Raman spectroscopy\nto be used in the presence of light artifacts to detect invasive cancer\ncells, thereby enhancing clinical translation ability and robustness\nfor intraoperative use. The team was able to achieve an accuracy of\nabout 90%.60 Liu and group proposed a new\nmethod for the data analysis of Raman spectra, which was previously\ncommonly used in pattern recognition. It is a neural network-based\nalgorithm and is called learning vector quantization (LVQ). The normal\nand glioma tissue diagnosis accuracy was 85.7% and 89.5%, respectively.52\n      An SVM algorithm was introduced with a\n2-level discriminant analysis\nto predict the primary tumors of brain metastases. The results obtained\nvia radial-SVM surpassed that of linear-SVM and PLS-DA. The algorithm\nprediction was 99% accurate in successfully identifying the independent\nprimary tumors.58 In another study, three\nclassifiers (LDA, KNN, and SVM) went through both principal components\nand sub-band feature extraction to improve the classification efficiency\nof Raman spectroscopy. In this modified feature-driven classifier\nsetup, LDA negatively performed with a 1.16% reduction in efficiency,\nbut the other two classifiers KNN and SVM improved by 25% and 26.25%,\ncorrespondingly.32 One machine learning\nalgorithm used was developed using Scikit-learn to classify performance\nwith leave-one-patient-out cross-validation: gradient boosting trees\nand random forest.7\n9\n      Conclusion\n      The review clearly establishes\nRaman to be a potential method in\nthe detection, monitoring, and surgery of brain cancer. This can go\nas a standalone tool to improve the lives of brain tumor patients\nin the future. This can also proceed as a multimodal means along with\nconventional imaging instruments like the MRI and CT scanning techniques.\nUnlike histopathology which requires hours of time and expert neuropathologists\nto analyze, Raman spectroscopy can provide unbiased accurate interpreted\ndata in real-time. It also does not need any preprocessing or staining.28 Though currently, there are not any Raman-approved\nsurgery for brain cancer, the idea of it becoming reality is not far-fetched.\nWith setups like SERS which require surface enhancers, the surface\nenhancer can be made with a smart nanoparticle system thereby they\nbecome either pH, temperature, or photosensitive so that interaction\nwith a laser can ablate the tumors. But, to attain these sooner, there\nneeds to be even wider human clinical trials considering as many parameters\nas possible to bring it to the clinic for use. Further, more accurate\nML tools are necessary to interpret the data precisely. So, the results\ncan be used a step further to help in personalized medicine and decide\non a regime of treatment based on the biomolecular signatures observed.\n10\n      Limitations and Future Prospects\n      A\nsimple web-search on the FDA clinical trials site for the term\nRaman spectroscopy shows about 108 clinical studies as of mid-June\n2023, including completed, withdrawn, currently active, and recruiting.\nOf these, only 2 studies one completed and one recruiting are related\nto the brain but that too not of brain cancer.79 This clearly shows the need for more clinical trials using\nRaman spectroscopy as different modalities. But this is due to few\npractical hurdles, like the interference of ambient light with/and\nfluorescence, Raman\u2019s sensitivity to water. The major hindrance\nis the portability of the instrument, and real-time data analysis\nwith minimal to no delay and high complexity of the instrument for\na clinician to handle instigates the need for a Raman spectroscopy\nexpert instead of an expert neuropathologist. So, this does not make\nmuch of a difference. And, of course, the cost of the setup has to\ncome down many-fold. The future research in the field must concentrate\non the miniaturization, simplification, and cost-effectiveness of\nthe instrument without compromising on the safety and efficiency.\nNow, with the rise of AI, potent ML models should be developed to\nincrease the accuracy of the results. Recently, Jiang et al. have\ncome up with the first open data set of 1300+ clinical SRH images\nfrom more than 300 patients called OpenSRH.80 This kind of open public data sets and repositories, say a universal\nrepository created by a consortium including academic, industry, and\nhospitals, can lead to enhanced collaborative research in Raman spectroscopy\nleading to a quicker progression toward affordable, safe, and efficient\nstate-of-the-art Raman spectroscopy ready for clinical use.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10413827/\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c01848",
