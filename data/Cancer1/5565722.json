    "title": "Drug Delivery to Melanoma Brain Metastases: Can Current Challenges Lead to New Opportunities?",
    "abstract": "Melanoma has a high propensity to metastasize to the brain, and patients with melanoma brain \nmetastases (MBM) have an extremely poor prognosis. The recent approval of several molecularly-\ntargeted agents (e.g., BRAF, MEK inhibitors) and biologics (anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-\nL1 antibodies) has brought new hope to patients suffering from this formerly untreatable and lethal \ndisease. Importantly, there have been recent reports of success in some clinical studies examining \nthe efficacy of both targeted agents and immunotherapies that show similar response rates in both \nbrain metastases and extracranial disease. While these studies are encouraging, there remains \nsignificant room for improvement in the treatment of MBM, given the lack of durable response \nand the development of resistance to current therapies. Critical questions remain regarding \nmechanisms that lead to this lack of durable response and development of resistance, and how \nthose mechanisms may differ in systemic sites versus brain metastases. One issue that may not be \nfully appreciated is that the delivery of several small molecule molecularly-targeted therapies to \nthe brain is often restricted due to active efflux at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) interface. \nInadequate local drug concentrations may be partially responsible for the development of unique \npatterns of resistance at metastatic sites in the brain. It is clear that there can be local, \nheterogeneous BBB breakdown in MBM, as exemplified by contrast-enhancement on T1-\nweighted MR imaging. However, it is possible that the successful treatment of MBM with small \nmolecule targeted therapies will depend, in part, on the ability of these therapies to penetrate an \nintact BBB and reach the protected micro-metastases (so called \u201csub-clinical\u201d disease) that escape \nearly detection by contrast-enhanced MRI, as well as regions of tumor within MRI-detectable \nmetastases that may have a less compromised BBB. The emergence of resistance in MBM may be \nrelated to several diverse, yet interrelated, factors including the distinct microenvironment of the \nbrain and inadequate brain penetration of targeted therapies to specific regions of tumor. The \ntumor microenvironment has been ascribed to play a key role in steering the course of disease \nprogression, by dictating changes in expression of tumor drivers and resistance-related signaling \n*Corresponding author: William F.
