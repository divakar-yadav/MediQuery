    "title": "Engineering Challenges for Brain Tumor Immunotherapy",
    "abstract": "Malignant brain tumors represent one of the most devastating forms of cancer with abject survival \nrates that have not changed in the past 60 years. This is partly because the brain is a critical organ, \nand poses unique anatomical, physiological, and immunological barriers. The unique interplay of \nthese barriers also provides an opportunity for creative engineering solutions. Cancer \nimmunotherapy, a means of harnessing the host immune system for anti-tumor efficacy, is \nbecoming a standard approach for treating many cancers. However, its use in brain tumors is not \nwidespread. This review discusses the current approaches, and hurdles to these approaches in \ntreating brain tumors, with a focus on immunotherapies. We identify critical barriers to \nimmunoengineering brain tumor therapies and discuss possible solutions to these challenges.\nGraphical Abstract\n\u2020Corresponding author: ravi@duke.edu.\n*These authors contributed equally; listed alphabetically.\nPublisher's Disclaimer: This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.
