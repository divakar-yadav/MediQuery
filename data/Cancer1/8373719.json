    "abstract": "Metabolism of the essential amino acid tryptophan is a key metabolic pathway that restricts \nantitumor immunity and is a drug development target for cancer immunotherapy. Tryptophan \nmetabolism is active in brain tumors including gliomas and promotes a malignant phenotype \nand contributes to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In recent years, improved \nunderstanding of the regulation and downstream function of tryptophan metabolism has been \nsignificantly expanded beyond the initial in vitro observation that the enzyme indoleamine-2,3-\ndioxygenase 1 (IDO1) promotes the depletion of intracellular tryptophan. Here, we revisit the \nspecific roles of tryptophan metabolites in regulating brain functioning and neuronal integrity as \nwell as in the context of brain tumors. This review summarizes recent developments in identifying \nkey regulators, as well as the cellular and molecular effects of tryptophan metabolism with a \nparticular focus on potential therapeutic targets in glioma\nCorresponding authors: Platten, Michael (m.platten@dkfz.de), Opitz, Christiane A (c.opitz@dkfz.de). \nConflict of interest statement\nM.P. and C.A.O. are listed as inventors on patents on diagnostic tools for tryptophan metabolism (WO2008108994 (M.
