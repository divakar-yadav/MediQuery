    "abstract": "Spread of cancer to the brain remains an unmet clinical need in spite of the increasing number of \ncases among patients with lung, breast cancer and melanoma most notably. Although research on \nbrain metastasis was considered a minor aspect in the past due to its untreatable nature and \ninvariable lethality, nowadays limited but encouraging examples have questioned this statement \nmaking it more attractive for basic and clinical researchers. Evidences of its own biological \nidentity (i.e. specific microenvironment) and particular therapeutic requirements (i.e. presence of \nblood-brain barrier, blood-tumor barrier, molecular differences with the primary tumor) are \nthought to be critical aspects that must be functionally exploited using preclinical models.\nWe present the coordinated effort of 19 laboratories to compile comprehensive information related \nto brain metastasis experimental models. Each lab has provided details on the cancer cell lines \nthey have generated or characterized as being capable of forming metastatic colonies in the brain, \nas well as principle methodologies of brain metastasis research. The Brain Metastasis Cell Lines \nPanel (BrMPanel) represents the first of its class and includes information about the cell line, how \ntropism to the brain was established and the behavior of each model in vivo.\nThese and other aspects described are intended to assist investigators in choosing the most suitable \ncell line for research on brain metastasis. The main goal of this effort is to facilitate research on \nthis unmet clinical need, to improve models through a collaborative environment, and to promote \nthe exchange of information on these valuable resources.\nKeywords\nBrain metastasis; Cell lines; Organotropism; Resource; Open-source",
