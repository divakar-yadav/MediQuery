    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain cancer in adults. Despite\nsignificant advances in treatment and intensive research, the prognosis for patients with GBM\nremains poor. Therapeutic challenges for GBM include its invasive nature, the proximity of the tumor\nto vital brain structures often preventing total resection, and the resistance of recurrent GBM to\nconventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Gene therapy has been proposed as a useful adjuvant\nfor GBM, to be used in conjunction with current treatment. Work from our laboratory has shown\nthat combination of conditional cytotoxic with immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of\nGBM elicits regression of large intracranial tumor masses and anti-tumor immunological memory\nin syngeneic rodent models of GBM. In this review we examined the currently available animal\nmodels for GBM, including rodent transplantable models, endogenous rodent tumor models and\nspontaneous GBM in dogs. We discuss non-invasive surrogate end points to assess tumor progression\nand therapeutic efficacy, such as behavioral tests and circulating biomarkers. Growing preclinical\nand clinical data contradict the old dogma that cytotoxic anti-cancer therapy would lead to an\nimmune-suppression that would impair the ability of the immune system to mount an anti-tumor\nresponse. The implications of the findings reviewed indicate that combination of cytotoxic therapy\nwith immunotherapy will lead to synergistic antitumor efficacy with reduced neurotoxicity and\nsupports the clinical implementation of combined cytotoxic-immunotherapeutic strategies for the\ntreatment of patients with GBM.\nKeywords\nImmunotherapy; apoptosis; cancer models; HMGB1; Flt3L; HSV1-TK\n\u00a9 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.\n*Address correspondence to this author at the Gene Therapeutics Research Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Department of\nMedicine and Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los\nAngeles, 8700 Beverly Blvd., Davis Bldg., Room 5090, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA; Tel: 310-423-7303; Fax: 310-423-7308;\ncastromg@cshs.org.\nNIH Public Access\nAuthor Manuscript\nCurr Gene Ther.
