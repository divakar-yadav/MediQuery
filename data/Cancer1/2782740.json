    "abstract": "Cancer propagating cells (CPCs) within primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors (glioblastoma\nmultiforme (GBM), medulloblastoma (MB) and ependymoma) might be integral to tumor\ndevelopment and perpetuation. These cells, also known as brain cancer propagating cells (BCPCs),\nhave the ability to self-renew and proliferate. BCPCs can initiate new tumors in mice with high\nefficiency and these exhibit many features that are characteristic of patient's brain tumors.\nAccumulating evidence suggests that BCPCs might originate from the transformation of neural stem\ncells (NSCs) and their progenitors. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that NSC surface markers\nalso define BCPCs. Ultimately, treatments that include specific targeting of BCPCs might potentially\nbe more effective at treating the entire tumor mass, translating to improved patient survival and\nquality of life.",
