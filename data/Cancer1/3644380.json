    "title": "Proteoglycans and their roles in brain cancer",
    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM), a malignant brain cancer, is characterized by abnormal activation of\nreceptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways and poor prognosis. Extracellular\nproteoglycans, including heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, play critical roles in the\nregulation of cell signaling and migration via interactions with extracellular ligands, growth factor\nreceptors, extracellular matrix components, and intracellular enzymes and structural proteins. In\ncancer, proteoglycans help drive multiple oncogenic pathways in tumor cells and promote critical\ntumor-microenvironment interactions. In this review, we summarize the evidence for proteoglycan\nfunction in gliomagenesis and we examine the expression of proteoglycans and their modifying\nenzymes in human GBM using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate an association between specific proteoglycan alterations and changes in RTKs. Based\non these data we propose a model in which proteoglycans and their modifying enzymes promote\nRTK signaling and progression in GBM, and we suggest cancer associated proteoglycans are\npromising biomarkers for disease and therapeutic targets.\nKeywords\nProteoglycans; HSPG; CSPG; SULFs; GBM",
