    "abstract": "Many factors contribute to the poor survival of malignant brain tumor patients, some of which are not easily \nremedied. However, one contributor to the lack of progress that may be modifiable is poor clinical trial accrual. \nSurveys of brain tumor patients and neuro-oncology providers suggest that clinicians do a poor job of discussing \nclinical trials with patients and referring patients for clinical trials. \nYet, data from the Cancer Action Network of the \nAmerican Cancer Society suggest that most eligible oncology patients asked to enroll on a clinical trial will agree \nto do so. To this end, the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) in collaboration with the Response Assessment in \nNeuro-Oncology (RANO) Working Group, patient advocacy groups, clinical trial cooperative groups, including the \nAdult Brain Tumor Consortium (ABTC), and other partners are working together with the intent to double clinical \ntrial accrual over the next 5\u00a0years. Here we describe the factors contributing to poor clinical trial accrual in neuro-\noncology and offer possible solutions.\nThe prognosis for adult patients with malignant brain \ntumors remains poor, with only minor improvements in \nsurvival over the past few decades. While many factors \ncontribute to this lack of progress, a major impediment \nto improving outcomes is poor clinical trial accrual. In \ngeneral, when cancer patients are eligible and offered \na clinical trial, more than 50% of patients enroll.1\u20135 Yet, \nthe percentage of patients who actually enroll on clinical \ntrials is much lower. In 2002, Chang et\u00a0al reported that only \n21.3% of malignant glioma patients participated in a clinical \ntrial.6 Unfortunately, accrual to neuro-oncology trials has \nremained stagnant over the past decade.
