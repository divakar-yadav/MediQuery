    "abstract": "Brain cancer is a devastating disease. Despite extensive research, treatment of brain tumors has\nbeen largely ineffective and the diagnosis of brain cancer remains uniformly fatal. Failure of brain\ncancer treatment may be in part due to limitations in drug delivery, influenced by the ABC drug\nefflux transporters P-gp and BCRP at the blood-brain and blood-tumor barriers, in brain tumor\ncells, as well as in brain tumor stem-like cells. P-gp and BCRP limit various anti-cancer drugs\nfrom entering the brain and tumor tissues, thus rendering chemotherapy ineffective. To overcome\nthis obstacle, two strategies \u2013 targeting transporter regulation and direct transporter inhibition \u2013\nhave been proposed. In this review, we focus on these strategies. We first introduce the latest\nfindings on signaling pathways that could potentially be targeted to down-regulate P-gp and BCRP\nexpression and/or transport activity. We then highlight in detail the new paradigm of P-gp and\nBCRP working as a \u201ccooperative team of gatekeepers\u201d at the blood-brain barrier, discuss its\nramifications for brain cancer therapy, and summarize the latest findings on dual P-gp/BCRP\ninhibitors. Finally, we provide a brief summary with conclusions and outline the perspectives for\nfuture research endeavors in this field.\nKeywords\nBCRP; P-gp; brain cancer; glioblastoma; multidrug resistance; blood-brain barrier; regulation;\ninhibition\n1",
