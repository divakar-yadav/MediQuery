    "abstract": "The Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS), in collaboration with the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (CDC) and National Cancer Institute (NCI), is the largest population-based cancer registry \nfocused exclusively on primary brain and other central nervous system (CNS) tumors in the United States (US) and \nrepresents the entire US population. This report contains the most up-to-date population-based data on primary \nbrain tumors available and supersedes all previous reports in terms of completeness and accuracy and is the first \nCBTRUS Report to provide the distribution of molecular markers for selected brain and CNS tumor histologies. All \nrates are age-adjusted using the 2000 US standard population and presented per 100,000 population. \nThe average \nannual age-adjusted incidence rate (AAAIR) of all malignant and non-malignant brain and other CNS tumors was \n24.25 (Malignant AAAIR=7\n.06, Non-malignant AAAIR=17\n.18). This overall rate was higher in females compared to \nmales (26.95 versus 21.35) and non-Hispanics compared to Hispanics (24.68 versus 22.12). The most commonly \noccurring malignant brain and other CNS tumor was glioblastoma (14.3% of all tumors and 49.1% of malignant \ntumors), and the most common non-malignant tumor was meningioma (39.0% of all tumors and 54.5% of non-\nmalignant tumors). Glioblastoma was more common in males, and meningioma was more common in females. In \nchildren and adolescents (age 0\u201319\u00a0years), the incidence rate of all primary brain and other CNS tumors was 6.21. \nAn estimated 88,190 new cases of malignant and non-malignant brain and other CNS tumors are expected to be \ndiagnosed in the US population in 2021 (25,690 malignant and 62,500 non-malignant). There were 83,029 deaths \nattributed to malignant brain and other CNS tumors between 2014 and 2018. This represents an average annual \nmortality rate of 4.43 per 100,000 and an average of 16,606 deaths per year. \nThe five-year relative survival rate fol-\nlowing diagnosis of a malignant brain and other CNS tumor was 35.6%, for a non-malignant brain and other CNS \ntumors the five-year relative survival rate was 91.8%.\nEXECUTIVE\u00a0SUMMARY\nThe Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States \n(CBTRUS), in collaboration with the CDC and NCI, is the \nlargest population-based registry focused exclusively on \nprimary brain and other central nervous system (CNS) \ntumors in the United States (US) and represents the en-\ntire US population. The CBTRUS Statistical Report: \nPrimary Brain and Other Central Nervous System Tumors \nDiagnosed in the United States in 2014\u20132018 contains the \nmost up-to-date population-based data on primary brain \niii1",
