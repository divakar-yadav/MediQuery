    "title": "An Epigenetic Gateway to Brain Tumor Cell Identity",
    "abstract": "Precise targeting of genetic lesions alone has been insufficient to extend brain tumor patient \nsurvival. Brain cancer cells are diverse in their genetic, metabolic, and microenvironmental \ncompositions, accounting for their phenotypic heterogeneity and disparate responses to therapy. \nThese factors converge at the level of the epigenome, representing a unified node that can be \ndisrupted by pharmacologic inhibition. Aberrant epigenomes define many childhood and adult \nbrain cancers, as demonstrated by widespread changes to DNA methylation patterns, redistribution \nof histone marks, and disruption of chromatin structure. In this review, we describe the \nconvergence of genetic, metabolic, and micro-environmental factors upon mechanisms of \nepigenetic deregulation in brain cancer. We discuss how aberrant epigenetic pathways identified in \nbrain tumors affect cell identity, cell state, and neoplastic transformation, in addition to the \npotential to exploit these alterations as novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of brain \ncancer.",
