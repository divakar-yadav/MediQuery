    "title": "Brain Cancer Stem Cells Display Preferential Sensitivity to Akt Inhibition",
    "abstract": "Malignant brain tumors are among the most lethal cancers, and conventional therapies are largely\nlimited to palliation. Novel therapies targeted against specific molecular pathways may offer\nimproved efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to conventional therapies, but initial clinical trials\nof molecular targeted agents in brain cancer therapy have been frequently disappointing. In brain\ntumors and other cancers, subpopulations of tumor cells have recently been characterized by their\nability to self-renew and initiate tumors. Although these cancer stem cells, or tumor initiating cells,\nare often only present in small numbers in human tumors, mounting evidence suggests that cancer\nstem cells contribute to tumor maintenance and therapeutic resistance. Thus, the development of\ntherapies that target cancer stem cell signal transduction and biologies may improve brain tumor\npatient survival. We now demonstrate that populations enriched for cancer stem cells are\npreferentially sensitive to an inhibitor of Akt, a prominent cell survival and invasion signaling node.\nTreatment with an Akt inhibitor more potently reduced the numbers of viable brain cancer stem cells\nrelative to matched non-stem cancer cells associated with a preferential induction of apoptosis and\na suppression of neurosphere formation. Akt inhibition also reduced the motility and invasiveness\nof all tumor cells but had a greater impact on cancer stem cell behaviors. Furthermore, inhibition of\nAkt activity in cancer stem cells increased survival of immunocompromised mice bearing human\nglioma xenografts in vivo. Together, these results suggest that Akt inhibitors may function as effective\nanti-cancer stem cell therapies.\nCorresponding Author: Jeremy N.
