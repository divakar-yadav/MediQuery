    "description": "Experimental Procedures\n      \n        Materials\n        Chondroitinase ABC enzyme was from Sigma-Aldrich. Heparan sulfate disaccharides and chondroitin sulfate disaccharides were purchased from Celsus Laboratories. Heparin lyases I, II, and III were generous gifts from Prof. Jian Liu (UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy). GlycanPac AXH-1 columns (2.1\u00a0mm\u221715\u00a0cm and 300\u00a0\u03bcm\u221715\u00a0cm) were generous gifts from ThermoFisher Scientific. Trypsin gold, mass spectrometry grade was from Promega Corp.\n      \n      \n        Experimental Design and Statistical Rationale\n        In total, 43 tissue microarray (TMA) cores were used; 39 consisted of GBM subtypes (11 CLA, 9 MES, and 19 PRO) and four control cores. The control cores were from a single patient and corresponded to nonneoplastic regions (white matter and cortex) of the resected tissue and were not independent of one another. There was no neural subtype included in this work. For each molecular class, one biological replicate as a single LC-MS/MS run was performed. Although a limited number of controls were available, all results were subjected to multiple test corrections. All the samples were handled for sample processing and acquired on the instrument (for both glycomics and proteomics) at the same time to avoid any sample handling or instrument bias. Standard disaccharides, peptide retention time mixtures, and blanks were run routinely in between the samples. In addition, the disaccharide and peptide samples were spiked with internal controls. The subtypes were blinded, and all samples were acquired on the instrument randomly. Further, the peaks QC function of the PEAKS Studio X+ software package (Bioinformatics Solutions, Inc) was used as a quality control (QC) check for the data. supplemental Fig.\u00a0S1A shows peaks QC plots that show protein, peptide, MS1, and MS/MS trends among 43 samples were very similar, indicating the high quality of the data acquired. In addition, supplemental Fig.\u00a0S1, B\u2013D shows representative extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) of spiked peptide retention time calibration mix for proteomic analysis and disaccharide standards for HS and CS glycomic analysis, respectively. All spiked internal standards were reproducible with respect to their retention times and intensities.\n      \n      \n        Tumor Sample Information\n        GBM was identified from records in the UCSF Brain Tumor Center Biorepository and the Division of Neuropathology, Department of Pathology, at UCSF. While referred to as WHO grade IV GBM, IDH-WT, and GBM, IDH-mutant, as per the WHO 2016 classification (23), it is recognized that going forward these tumors will be known as GBM, IDH-WT, CNS WHO grade 4, and astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, CNS WHO grade 4, respectively, per the CNS WHO 2021 (24). The ethics approval number for the use of de-identified human biospecimens is 10-01318. These studies were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments. The transcriptional subgroup was determined based upon NanoString analysis of total RNA as previously described (25), and tumors were assigned GBM subtypes based on genome patterns (8): 11 CLA, nine MES, and 19 PRO. Briefly, For NanoString analysis, total RNA was isolated from tumor cores (2- to 3 1-mm cores) from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks containing >75% tumor cells as determined by H&E staining, according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (RNEasy FFPE kit; Qiagen). Concentrations were determined using NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies), and RNA integrity was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). A custom code set was generated, and probes for the analysis were synthesized by NanoString technologies. The dataset included probes for 14 genes of interest, including five PRO genes [delta like canonical notch ligand 3 (DLL3), neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1), oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (OLIG2), SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9), and SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2)], three MES genes [chitinase 3 like 1 (CHI3L1), TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1), and CD44], and six normalizing genes [actin beta (ACTB), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), RNA polymerase II subunit A (POLR2A), succinate dehydrogenase complex flavoprotein subunit A (SDHA), and TATA-box binding protein (TBP)]. RNA (200\u00a0ng) was analyzed with the NanoString nCounter Analysis System at NanoString Technologies according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (NanoString Technologies). GBM exhibits both intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity. In selecting regions of interest for analysis, for each case, all molecular information and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cases as clinical H&E-stained slides from the resection were reviewed by a board-certified neuropathologist (J.J.P.) and two representative regions of high tumor (dense tumor regions) content or \u201ccentral\u201d tumor were selected for each case to be included in the University of California, San Francisco Brain Tumor Center Biorepository. These regions were used to generate TMAs for profiling and used for the isolation of RNA for transcriptional analysis. The sampling of multiple tumor regions from regions with high-tumor content tends to sample tumor clones that can help drive tumor progression (26). The analysis of different regions of the same tumor is an area of great interest; however, it was not the focus of this manuscript and would be interesting to explore in the future. An example of representative images of H&E-stained sections of TMA cores from 08257(MES) and 08306 (PRO) (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S2, A and B) highlight tumor cell density in regions of central tumor. TMA cores region included in each core include tumor cells, vasculature, and eosinophilic regions containing both cell processes and ECM. Table\u00a01 provides detailed information on the cases, including disease type, GBM subtype, IDH1 and EGFR status, patient age, sex (M; male, F; female), treatment, anatomic location, and tumor region. Supplemental Table\u00a0S1 provides information, including raw file names and peak database search numbers for proteomics analysis.Table\u00a01Detailed information on the cases, including disease type, GBM subtype, IDH1 and EGFR status, patient age, sex (M; male, F; female), treatment, anatomic location, and tumor regionUCSF code2016 WHO integrated diagnosisEGFRSubtypeSexAgeNewly diagnosed (N) or recurrent (R)TreatmentAnatomic locationTumor region06969Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnknownMesenchymalM59NNoneParietalCentral07034Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeAmplifiedClassicalF51NNoneParietalCentral07686Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeAmplifiedMesenchymalF46NNoneTemporalCentral07880Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeAmplifiedClassicalM40NNoneFrontalCentral08216Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnknownClassicalM73NNoneFrontalCentral08257Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnknownMesenchymalF55NNoneParietooccipitalCentral08306Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnknownProneuralM79NNoneFrontalCentral08318Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnknownProneuralM60NNoneTemporalCentral08345Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnknownProneuralM66NNoneFrontalCentral08351Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnknownProneuralF67NNoneOccipitalCentral8386Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnamplifiedProneuralM48NNoneFrontalCentral08624Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnamplifiedProneuralM63NNoneParietalCentral08858Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnamplifiedMesenchymalF61NNoneTemporalCentral09259Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnamplifiedProneuralM73NNoneFrontotemporalCentral09295Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeAmplifiedClassicalF60NNoneTemporoparietalCentral09459Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeAmplifiedClassicalF70NNoneParietalCentral08061Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeAmplifiedClassicalM44RNoneFrontalCentral5705Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeAmplifiedMesenchymalF51RXRT+TMZFrontalCentral06884Glioblastoma, IDH-mutantUnamplifiedClassicalF31NNoneFrontalCentral07491Glioblastoma, IDH-mutantUnamplifiedProneuralF36NNoneOccipitalCentral07884Glioblastoma, IDH-mutantUnamplifiedProneuralM33NNoneFrontalCentral08354Glioblastoma, IDH-mutantUnknownProneuralF20NNoneParietalCentral7499Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnamplifiedMesenchymalF71NNoneTemporalCentral9418Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnknownClassicalF47NNoneTemporoparietalCentralControlsDescriptionClinical indicationControl 1Mild reactive astrogliosisUnknownF37White matterNAFrontotemporalMedically refractor seizuresControl 2Mild reactive astrogliosisUnknownF37Cerebral cortexNAFrontotemporalMedically refractor seizuresAbbreviations: GBM, glioblastoma; IDH1, isocitrate dehydrogenase\u00a01.\n      \n      \n        Automated Enzyme Addition to Tissue Surfaces With Inkjet Chip Printer\n        A chemical inkjet chip printer (Shimadzu CHIP-1000) was used for printing enzymes to tissue surfaces (the workflow is shown in supplemental Fig.\u00a0S3). This device is capable of applying minimal 500 pL solutions to tissue surfaces. The printer scans an image of the TMA slide, which enables the user to designate the cores to be analyzed. Next, 1\u00a0\u03bcl enzyme solution, sufficient to cover the entire core surface, was applied to each designated core using a user-defined printing pattern. To ensure exhaustive digestion, the enzyme printing process was repeated four times. The time interval for the repeated enzyme printing was 2\u00a0h. After the fourth enzyme printing, the TMA slides were incubated in a humidified digestion chamber at 37 \u00b0C, overnight. The detailed on-slide digestion protocol could be obtained from our previous publications (27, 28). Briefly, a mixture of 0.5 mU/\u03bcl heparin lyases I, II, and III was applied first, followed by overnight incubation. Second, a 1 mU/\u03bcl chondroitinase ABC enzyme solution was applied to the same spot. Finally, 100\u00a0ng/\u03bcl trypsin solution was applied to the spots.\n      \n      \n        Automated Extraction of Digested Molecules From Tissue surfaces With Nanomate Robot\n        Liquid extraction surface analysis entails automated extraction of compounds from tissue surfaces with minimized disturbance to tissue. A liquid extraction surface analysis module has been developed for the widely used Advion Triversa Nanomate (Advion Inc) LC/MS sample manipulation robot. The robot took 1\u00a0\u03bcl extraction buffer and delivered the solution to the designated core to form a 1.5\u00a0\u03bcm liquid microjunction. The digested products were resolved in the liquid microjunction and extracted from the tissue surface. This extraction process was repeated 5 times to enable maximum sample recovery from tissue surfaces. The optimum extraction buffer for digested GAGs and peptides was 0.3% ammonium hydroxide and 10% ACN/90% water/0.1% formic acid solution, respectively.\n      \n      \n        GAGs and Peptides Desalting\n        The GAG extractions were dried by vacuum centrifugation and desalted using an SEC column (Superdex peptide PC 3.2/30, GE Healthcare), using 25\u00a0mM ammonium acetate in 5% ACN (pH\u00a0= 4.4) as the mobile phase at an isocratic flow 0.04\u00a0ml/min for 60\u00a0min. The disaccharides eluted between 35 and 45\u00a0min and were detected using UV absorbance at 232\u00a0nm. The cleaned disaccharide samples were dried by vacuum centrifugation and stored at\u00a0\u221220 \u00b0C until analyzed using LC-MS/MS. The extracted peptides were dried in vacuum centrifugation and passed through C-18 zip tips (Thermo Fisher Scientific); the cleaned peptides were eluted using 60% ACN/water/0.1% TFA and dried by vacuum centrifugation. The cleaned peptides were further stored at\u00a0\u221220 \u00b0C until analyzed using LC-MS/MS.\n      \n      \n        Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) Glycomics Analysis\n        HS and CS disaccharides were analyzed using negative ionization mode electrospray LC-MS/MS as previously described (27, 29, 30). HILIC resins were de-packed from three 2.1\u00a0mm\u221715\u00a0cm chromatography columns (Thermo Dionex Glycan Pac AXH-1, Thermo Dionex Accucore Amide 150, and Waters BEH HILIC) and tested for HS disaccharides separation. Nano-HILIC columns (100\u00a0\u03bcm\u2217 15\u00a0cm) were packed in-house. The columns were mounted on Waters NanoAcquity chromatograph coupled to a Q-Exactive plus mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Tandem MS using higher energy collision-induced dissociation with a normalized collision energy of 30\u00a0eV was conducted to discriminate D2A0 from D0A6 and D2S0 from D0S6. Mass spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer with one microscan per spectrum for both MS and MS/MS in negative ionization mode. The resolving power for MS and MS/MS was set at 70,000 and 17,500. The precursor ion isolation window was set to 2 u. The mobile phase A is 50\u00a0mM ammonium formate, pH 4.4, and the mobile phase B is 95% ACN/5% HPLC water. The flow rate was set at 0.6 ul/min, and a gradient was set at 92.5% B to 50% B in 30\u00a0min, followed by 50% B to 20% B in 5\u00a0min, and then equilibration to 92% B in 20\u00a0min. For CS disaccharide analysis, 300\u00a0\u03bcm\u221715\u00a0cm column (packed with 1.9\u00a0\u03bcm Thermo Dionex Glycan Pac AXH- one resin, a generous gift from Thermo Dionex) was mounted to Waters Acquity chromatograph. It was interfaced to an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Tandem MS using CID with a normalized collision energy of 30\u00a0eV was conducted to discriminate D0a4 from D0a6. Mass spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer with one microscan per spectrum for both MS and MS/MS at negative mode. Resolving power for MS and MS/MS was set at 60,000 and 15,000, respectively. The isolation window for the targeted precursor is 3 u. The mobile phase A is 50\u00a0mM ammonium formate, pH 4.4, and the mobile phase B is 95% ACN/5% HPLC water. The LC was running at an isobaric gradient at 85%B with 7\u00a0\u03bcl/min. Each LC run was reduced to 20\u00a0min to maximize throughput. The relative and absolute abundance were determined using standard curves as previously described (30, 31).\n      \n      \n        Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry Proteomics Analysis\n        Nano-LC-MS/MS separation was performed using a nanoAcquity UPLC (Waters Technology) and Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Reversed phased C-18 analytical (BEH C18, 150\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0\u00d7 100\u00a0mm) and trapping (180\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0\u00d7 20\u00a0mm) columns from Waters technology were used with a 120\u00a0min method with a gradient from 2 to 98% acetonitrile in 97\u00a0min, using 99% water/1% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid as mobile phase A and 99% acetonitrile/1% water/0.1% formic acid as mobile phase B at a flow rate of 0.5\u00a0\u03bcl/min as previously described in (29). Data-dependent acquisition tandem MS was acquired in the positive ionization mode for the top 20 most abundant precursor ions. Full MS scans were acquired from m/z 350 to 1500 with 70,000 resolution using an automatic gain control target of 3e6 and maximum injection time (IT) of 50\u00a0ms. Dynamic exclusion (10\u00a0s) was enabled. The minimum threshold for precursor selection was set to 5\u00a0\u00d7 104. Precursor ions were fragmented using a resolution of 17,500 with a maximum injection time of 45\u00a0ms and an automatic gain control value of 2e5 using higher energy collision-induced dissociation with a normalized collision energy of 27\u00a0V.\n      \n      \n        Glycomics Data analysis Using Excel Spreadsheet\n        Student\u2019s t tests were performed with two-tailed distribution using Microsoft Excel to test for alterations in the obtained HS and CS disaccharide profiles. Different concentrations (500\u00a0fmol, 1 pmol, 2 pmol, 5 pmol, and 10 pmol) of eight HS standard disaccharides (D0A0, D2A0, D0A6, D2A6, D0S0, D2SO, D0S6, and D2S6) (Iduron) and four CS disaccharides (D0a0, D0a4, D0a6, D0a10) were run on LC-MS as triplicates, for plotting a MS standard curve. The MS/MS standard curve was plotted for different ratios of HS isoforms (D2A0/D0A6 and D2SO/D0S6) and CS isoforms (D0a4/D0a6) as previously described (24). The area under the curve for EIC for HS and CS disaccharides from each sample were obtained from the raw LC-MS/MS data using qualitative analysis software (version B.06; Agilent Technologies). The obtained abundances for each disaccharide were first normalized to a spiked internal control (as indicated above) and then further normalized to a standard curve to obtain an absolute abundance of HS or CS disaccharides (fmol). A relative abundance was then calculated for each HS (supplemental File S1) and CS (supplemental File S2) disaccharides. For differentiating the isoforms, EIC (MS/MS) for diagnostic ions as indicated in (28) for each CS and HS disaccharide isoform was extracted, and abundance was obtained from manual area calculation. The obtained abundance was then used to calculate the percent relative abundance of each isoform which was further normalized using the MS/MS standard curve to obtain the percent absolute abundance of each HS or CS isoform.\n      \n      \n        Protein Identification and Label-Free Quantification Using PEAKS Software\n        The raw LC-MS/MS data were converted into mzXML format using ProteoWizard msConvert (Version: 3.0.20210-c0fceb89a) (32). The data were searched using PeaksDB and PeaksPTM using Peaks Studio, version X+ (Bioinformatics Solutions, Inc) against the Uniprot/Swissprot database (release 2020_04) for homosapiens with a 1% false discovery rate and at least two unique peptides. False discovery rate (FDR) is estimated with the decoy fusion method, i.e., an enhanced target-decoy method using Peaks X+ software. A 10-ppm error tolerance for the precursor (MS1) and 0.02\u00a0Da mass error tolerance for fragment ions (MS2) were specified. A maximum of three missed cleavages per peptide was allowed for the database search, permitting nontryptic cleavage at one end. Trypsin was specified as the enzyme and carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification. The samples were tested for QC using PEAKS QC analysis; no significant difference with respect to protein, peptide MS1, MS2 trends, retention time, and precursor mass tolerance was observed for the samples indicating the high quality of the presented data (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S1). A peaksPTM search was queued after the peaksDB search, using advanced settings of a larger set of variable modifications, including hydroxylation P, oxidation M, hydroxylation K, hydroxylation-Hex K, hydroxylation-Hex-Hex K, HexNAc ST, HexHexNAc ST, phosphorylation STY, ubiquitination K, deamidation N, methoxy K, and nitrotyrosine Y. The final protein list generated was a combination of peaskDB and peaksPTM searches. The label-free quantification was achieved using the PEAKS Studio Quantification (PeaksQ)\u2014label-free module with a setting of mass error tolerance of 10\u00a0ppm and a retention time shift tolerance of 2.0\u00a0min. The identified protein, protein\u2013peptide, and peptide list from peaks PTM analysis are provided in supplemental File S3.\n      \n      \n        Matrisome Analysis\n        The label-free exported \u201cproteins\u201d (supplemental File S4) and \u201cprotein\u2013peptide\u201d (supplemental File S5) comma-separated lists were filtered to include only matrisome components as identified by Naba et\u00a0al. (33), supplemental File S6; matrisome proteins, and supplemental File S7; matrisome protein\u2013peptide.\n      \n      \n        Statistical Analysis and Visualization in RStudio and Microsoft Excel\n        The matrisome label-free quantified protein and their corresponding \u201cprotein\u2013peptide\u201d exports were used to compare the abundances of proteins and peptides between GBM and control samples and between GBM subtypes. Statistical analysis and visualization were carried out in RStudio (34). Heat maps of the log-transformed abundances of core matrisome components were generated using ggplot2. For statistical analysis, the compare means function was used with a FDR to correct for multiple comparisons (35). For visualization, boxplots of the log-transformed abundances of significantly differentially expressed proteins and peptides were generated. Further, the fold change and corresponding t-values were obtained by comparing normalized log-transformed protein and peptide abundances (FDR < 0.05) between various group comparisons, including GBM versus control, PRO/MES/CLA versus control, PRO versus MES, PRO versus CLA, and MES versus CLA analyses. The glycomics analysis was performed in Microsoft excel, and p-values were calculated by using heteroscedastic t test, and p-values < 0.05 were considered significant.\n      \n      \n        GlycReSoft Analysis\n        Data were searched using the publicly available in-house GlycReSoft graphical user interface (desktop version) (36, 37) (https://github.com/BostonUniversityCBMS). A fasta glycopeptide hypothesis comprising the glycosylated and matrisomal proteins generated using UniProtKB (supplemental File S8) was used. A combinatorial glycan hypothesis was used to generate possible glycan compositions with the following rules: HexNAc 2-8, Hex 3-10, Fuc 0-5, NeuAc 0-4, HexNAc > Fuc, HexNAc - 1 > NeuAc. A list of identified total glycopeptides divided by sample number and intensity signal is provided in supplemental File S9. The identified glycopeptides corresponded to N-glycosites and Ser/Thr-O-glycosites. Three glycopeptides that corresponded to paucimannosidic N-glycosylation were detected in a few of the samples. These did not pass the RAMZIS score threshold as described in the next paragraph.\n      \n      \n        Glycopeptide Similarity Analysis\n        The glycopeptides identified by GlycReSoft (supplemental File S9) were analyzed using RAMZIS, an R toolkit for assessing glycoproteomic data using contextual similarity (38). RAMZIS generates bootstrapped datasets to simulate comparisons that provide information on the consistency of the sample groups, their ability to be used in the comparison, the likelihood of a systemic difference, and the best candidates for further analysis. Using RAMZIS, each sample group was assessed for internal consistency and put into pairwise comparisons: the control was compared to an aggregate of the CLA, MES, and PRO subtypes as well as to each subtype on its own; the subtypes were similarly compared against each other. The following standards were used within the RAMZIS framework. For a dataset to be used in a comparison, it had to have an internal confidence score greater than 2, indicating that the internal similarity simulations, or internal similarity distribution, were on average more than two weighted standard deviations from the mean of the test similarity distribution. The test similarity distribution was only considered to reliably emulate the comparison if the original data comparison, or the Observed Similarity, was within the central two quartiles of the test distribution as a percentile or within two standard deviations of the test distribution mean; if it fell outside this region, then RAMZIS was not considered to emulate the comparison well. The general comparison was considered likely to find a systemic difference between the glycopeptide distributions if the test similarity distribution and null similarity distribution, the simulation of the null hypothesis of equivalent glycopeptide distributions, had a false positive overlap less than 0.05 or 5% and a false negative overlap less than 0.20 or 20%. Individual glycopeptides were reported with QCs that indicated if there were more than 25% overlap between their test and internal distributions, indicating the combined false positive and false negative rates; they were ranked according to the test distributions\u2019 separation to the respective null distributions with lower scores indicating a greater likelihood of a difference existing. These rankings were then assessed manually.\n      \n      \n        Gene Set Enrichment and Network Topology Analysis\n        The matrisome (supplemental File S10) differentially expressed protein and peptide lists (FDR < 0.05) for GBM versus control, and all subtypes comparisons were analyzed using WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt; http://www.webgestalt.org/) (39), for gene set enrichment (GSEA) and network topology analysis (NTA) to identify enriched GO terms (biological process, cellular component, molecular function, pathways, and networks specific to control and GBM subtypes).\nMaterials\n        Chondroitinase ABC enzyme was from Sigma-Aldrich. Heparan sulfate disaccharides and chondroitin sulfate disaccharides were purchased from Celsus Laboratories. Heparin lyases I, II, and III were generous gifts from Prof. Jian Liu (UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy). GlycanPac AXH-1 columns (2.1\u00a0mm\u221715\u00a0cm and 300\u00a0\u03bcm\u221715\u00a0cm) were generous gifts from ThermoFisher Scientific. Trypsin gold, mass spectrometry grade was from Promega Corp.\nExperimental Design and Statistical Rationale\n        In total, 43 tissue microarray (TMA) cores were used; 39 consisted of GBM subtypes (11 CLA, 9 MES, and 19 PRO) and four control cores. The control cores were from a single patient and corresponded to nonneoplastic regions (white matter and cortex) of the resected tissue and were not independent of one another. There was no neural subtype included in this work. For each molecular class, one biological replicate as a single LC-MS/MS run was performed. Although a limited number of controls were available, all results were subjected to multiple test corrections. All the samples were handled for sample processing and acquired on the instrument (for both glycomics and proteomics) at the same time to avoid any sample handling or instrument bias. Standard disaccharides, peptide retention time mixtures, and blanks were run routinely in between the samples. In addition, the disaccharide and peptide samples were spiked with internal controls. The subtypes were blinded, and all samples were acquired on the instrument randomly. Further, the peaks QC function of the PEAKS Studio X+ software package (Bioinformatics Solutions, Inc) was used as a quality control (QC) check for the data. supplemental Fig.\u00a0S1A shows peaks QC plots that show protein, peptide, MS1, and MS/MS trends among 43 samples were very similar, indicating the high quality of the data acquired. In addition, supplemental Fig.\u00a0S1, B\u2013D shows representative extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) of spiked peptide retention time calibration mix for proteomic analysis and disaccharide standards for HS and CS glycomic analysis, respectively. All spiked internal standards were reproducible with respect to their retention times and intensities.\nTumor Sample Information\n        GBM was identified from records in the UCSF Brain Tumor Center Biorepository and the Division of Neuropathology, Department of Pathology, at UCSF. While referred to as WHO grade IV GBM, IDH-WT, and GBM, IDH-mutant, as per the WHO 2016 classification (23), it is recognized that going forward these tumors will be known as GBM, IDH-WT, CNS WHO grade 4, and astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, CNS WHO grade 4, respectively, per the CNS WHO 2021 (24). The ethics approval number for the use of de-identified human biospecimens is 10-01318. These studies were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments. The transcriptional subgroup was determined based upon NanoString analysis of total RNA as previously described (25), and tumors were assigned GBM subtypes based on genome patterns (8): 11 CLA, nine MES, and 19 PRO. Briefly, For NanoString analysis, total RNA was isolated from tumor cores (2- to 3 1-mm cores) from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks containing >75% tumor cells as determined by H&E staining, according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (RNEasy FFPE kit; Qiagen). Concentrations were determined using NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies), and RNA integrity was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). A custom code set was generated, and probes for the analysis were synthesized by NanoString technologies. The dataset included probes for 14 genes of interest, including five PRO genes [delta like canonical notch ligand 3 (DLL3), neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1), oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (OLIG2), SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9), and SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2)], three MES genes [chitinase 3 like 1 (CHI3L1), TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1), and CD44], and six normalizing genes [actin beta (ACTB), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), RNA polymerase II subunit A (POLR2A), succinate dehydrogenase complex flavoprotein subunit A (SDHA), and TATA-box binding protein (TBP)]. RNA (200\u00a0ng) was analyzed with the NanoString nCounter Analysis System at NanoString Technologies according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (NanoString Technologies). GBM exhibits both intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity. In selecting regions of interest for analysis, for each case, all molecular information and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cases as clinical H&E-stained slides from the resection were reviewed by a board-certified neuropathologist (J.J.P.) and two representative regions of high tumor (dense tumor regions) content or \u201ccentral\u201d tumor were selected for each case to be included in the University of California, San Francisco Brain Tumor Center Biorepository. These regions were used to generate TMAs for profiling and used for the isolation of RNA for transcriptional analysis. The sampling of multiple tumor regions from regions with high-tumor content tends to sample tumor clones that can help drive tumor progression (26). The analysis of different regions of the same tumor is an area of great interest; however, it was not the focus of this manuscript and would be interesting to explore in the future. An example of representative images of H&E-stained sections of TMA cores from 08257(MES) and 08306 (PRO) (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S2, A and B) highlight tumor cell density in regions of central tumor. TMA cores region included in each core include tumor cells, vasculature, and eosinophilic regions containing both cell processes and ECM. Table\u00a01 provides detailed information on the cases, including disease type, GBM subtype, IDH1 and EGFR status, patient age, sex (M; male, F; female), treatment, anatomic location, and tumor region. Supplemental Table\u00a0S1 provides information, including raw file names and peak database search numbers for proteomics analysis.Table\u00a01Detailed information on the cases, including disease type, GBM subtype, IDH1 and EGFR status, patient age, sex (M; male, F; female), treatment, anatomic location, and tumor regionUCSF code2016 WHO integrated diagnosisEGFRSubtypeSexAgeNewly diagnosed (N) or recurrent (R)TreatmentAnatomic locationTumor region06969Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnknownMesenchymalM59NNoneParietalCentral07034Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeAmplifiedClassicalF51NNoneParietalCentral07686Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeAmplifiedMesenchymalF46NNoneTemporalCentral07880Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeAmplifiedClassicalM40NNoneFrontalCentral08216Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnknownClassicalM73NNoneFrontalCentral08257Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnknownMesenchymalF55NNoneParietooccipitalCentral08306Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnknownProneuralM79NNoneFrontalCentral08318Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnknownProneuralM60NNoneTemporalCentral08345Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnknownProneuralM66NNoneFrontalCentral08351Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnknownProneuralF67NNoneOccipitalCentral8386Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnamplifiedProneuralM48NNoneFrontalCentral08624Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnamplifiedProneuralM63NNoneParietalCentral08858Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnamplifiedMesenchymalF61NNoneTemporalCentral09259Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnamplifiedProneuralM73NNoneFrontotemporalCentral09295Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeAmplifiedClassicalF60NNoneTemporoparietalCentral09459Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeAmplifiedClassicalF70NNoneParietalCentral08061Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeAmplifiedClassicalM44RNoneFrontalCentral5705Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeAmplifiedMesenchymalF51RXRT+TMZFrontalCentral06884Glioblastoma, IDH-mutantUnamplifiedClassicalF31NNoneFrontalCentral07491Glioblastoma, IDH-mutantUnamplifiedProneuralF36NNoneOccipitalCentral07884Glioblastoma, IDH-mutantUnamplifiedProneuralM33NNoneFrontalCentral08354Glioblastoma, IDH-mutantUnknownProneuralF20NNoneParietalCentral7499Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnamplifiedMesenchymalF71NNoneTemporalCentral9418Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtypeUnknownClassicalF47NNoneTemporoparietalCentralControlsDescriptionClinical indicationControl 1Mild reactive astrogliosisUnknownF37White matterNAFrontotemporalMedically refractor seizuresControl 2Mild reactive astrogliosisUnknownF37Cerebral cortexNAFrontotemporalMedically refractor seizuresAbbreviations: GBM, glioblastoma; IDH1, isocitrate dehydrogenase\u00a01.\nAutomated Enzyme Addition to Tissue Surfaces With Inkjet Chip Printer\n        A chemical inkjet chip printer (Shimadzu CHIP-1000) was used for printing enzymes to tissue surfaces (the workflow is shown in supplemental Fig.\u00a0S3). This device is capable of applying minimal 500 pL solutions to tissue surfaces. The printer scans an image of the TMA slide, which enables the user to designate the cores to be analyzed. Next, 1\u00a0\u03bcl enzyme solution, sufficient to cover the entire core surface, was applied to each designated core using a user-defined printing pattern. To ensure exhaustive digestion, the enzyme printing process was repeated four times. The time interval for the repeated enzyme printing was 2\u00a0h. After the fourth enzyme printing, the TMA slides were incubated in a humidified digestion chamber at 37 \u00b0C, overnight. The detailed on-slide digestion protocol could be obtained from our previous publications (27, 28). Briefly, a mixture of 0.5 mU/\u03bcl heparin lyases I, II, and III was applied first, followed by overnight incubation. Second, a 1 mU/\u03bcl chondroitinase ABC enzyme solution was applied to the same spot. Finally, 100\u00a0ng/\u03bcl trypsin solution was applied to the spots.\nAutomated Extraction of Digested Molecules From Tissue surfaces With Nanomate Robot\n        Liquid extraction surface analysis entails automated extraction of compounds from tissue surfaces with minimized disturbance to tissue. A liquid extraction surface analysis module has been developed for the widely used Advion Triversa Nanomate (Advion Inc) LC/MS sample manipulation robot. The robot took 1\u00a0\u03bcl extraction buffer and delivered the solution to the designated core to form a 1.5\u00a0\u03bcm liquid microjunction. The digested products were resolved in the liquid microjunction and extracted from the tissue surface. This extraction process was repeated 5 times to enable maximum sample recovery from tissue surfaces. The optimum extraction buffer for digested GAGs and peptides was 0.3% ammonium hydroxide and 10% ACN/90% water/0.1% formic acid solution, respectively.\nGAGs and Peptides Desalting\n        The GAG extractions were dried by vacuum centrifugation and desalted using an SEC column (Superdex peptide PC 3.2/30, GE Healthcare), using 25\u00a0mM ammonium acetate in 5% ACN (pH\u00a0= 4.4) as the mobile phase at an isocratic flow 0.04\u00a0ml/min for 60\u00a0min. The disaccharides eluted between 35 and 45\u00a0min and were detected using UV absorbance at 232\u00a0nm. The cleaned disaccharide samples were dried by vacuum centrifugation and stored at\u00a0\u221220 \u00b0C until analyzed using LC-MS/MS. The extracted peptides were dried in vacuum centrifugation and passed through C-18 zip tips (Thermo Fisher Scientific); the cleaned peptides were eluted using 60% ACN/water/0.1% TFA and dried by vacuum centrifugation. The cleaned peptides were further stored at\u00a0\u221220 \u00b0C until analyzed using LC-MS/MS.\nLiquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) Glycomics Analysis\n        HS and CS disaccharides were analyzed using negative ionization mode electrospray LC-MS/MS as previously described (27, 29, 30). HILIC resins were de-packed from three 2.1\u00a0mm\u221715\u00a0cm chromatography columns (Thermo Dionex Glycan Pac AXH-1, Thermo Dionex Accucore Amide 150, and Waters BEH HILIC) and tested for HS disaccharides separation. Nano-HILIC columns (100\u00a0\u03bcm\u2217 15\u00a0cm) were packed in-house. The columns were mounted on Waters NanoAcquity chromatograph coupled to a Q-Exactive plus mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Tandem MS using higher energy collision-induced dissociation with a normalized collision energy of 30\u00a0eV was conducted to discriminate D2A0 from D0A6 and D2S0 from D0S6. Mass spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer with one microscan per spectrum for both MS and MS/MS in negative ionization mode. The resolving power for MS and MS/MS was set at 70,000 and 17,500. The precursor ion isolation window was set to 2 u. The mobile phase A is 50\u00a0mM ammonium formate, pH 4.4, and the mobile phase B is 95% ACN/5% HPLC water. The flow rate was set at 0.6 ul/min, and a gradient was set at 92.5% B to 50% B in 30\u00a0min, followed by 50% B to 20% B in 5\u00a0min, and then equilibration to 92% B in 20\u00a0min. For CS disaccharide analysis, 300\u00a0\u03bcm\u221715\u00a0cm column (packed with 1.9\u00a0\u03bcm Thermo Dionex Glycan Pac AXH- one resin, a generous gift from Thermo Dionex) was mounted to Waters Acquity chromatograph. It was interfaced to an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Tandem MS using CID with a normalized collision energy of 30\u00a0eV was conducted to discriminate D0a4 from D0a6. Mass spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer with one microscan per spectrum for both MS and MS/MS at negative mode. Resolving power for MS and MS/MS was set at 60,000 and 15,000, respectively. The isolation window for the targeted precursor is 3 u. The mobile phase A is 50\u00a0mM ammonium formate, pH 4.4, and the mobile phase B is 95% ACN/5% HPLC water. The LC was running at an isobaric gradient at 85%B with 7\u00a0\u03bcl/min. Each LC run was reduced to 20\u00a0min to maximize throughput. The relative and absolute abundance were determined using standard curves as previously described (30, 31).\nLiquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry Proteomics Analysis\n        Nano-LC-MS/MS separation was performed using a nanoAcquity UPLC (Waters Technology) and Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Reversed phased C-18 analytical (BEH C18, 150\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0\u00d7 100\u00a0mm) and trapping (180\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0\u00d7 20\u00a0mm) columns from Waters technology were used with a 120\u00a0min method with a gradient from 2 to 98% acetonitrile in 97\u00a0min, using 99% water/1% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid as mobile phase A and 99% acetonitrile/1% water/0.1% formic acid as mobile phase B at a flow rate of 0.5\u00a0\u03bcl/min as previously described in (29). Data-dependent acquisition tandem MS was acquired in the positive ionization mode for the top 20 most abundant precursor ions. Full MS scans were acquired from m/z 350 to 1500 with 70,000 resolution using an automatic gain control target of 3e6 and maximum injection time (IT) of 50\u00a0ms. Dynamic exclusion (10\u00a0s) was enabled. The minimum threshold for precursor selection was set to 5\u00a0\u00d7 104. Precursor ions were fragmented using a resolution of 17,500 with a maximum injection time of 45\u00a0ms and an automatic gain control value of 2e5 using higher energy collision-induced dissociation with a normalized collision energy of 27\u00a0V.\nGlycomics Data analysis Using Excel Spreadsheet\n        Student\u2019s t tests were performed with two-tailed distribution using Microsoft Excel to test for alterations in the obtained HS and CS disaccharide profiles. Different concentrations (500\u00a0fmol, 1 pmol, 2 pmol, 5 pmol, and 10 pmol) of eight HS standard disaccharides (D0A0, D2A0, D0A6, D2A6, D0S0, D2SO, D0S6, and D2S6) (Iduron) and four CS disaccharides (D0a0, D0a4, D0a6, D0a10) were run on LC-MS as triplicates, for plotting a MS standard curve. The MS/MS standard curve was plotted for different ratios of HS isoforms (D2A0/D0A6 and D2SO/D0S6) and CS isoforms (D0a4/D0a6) as previously described (24). The area under the curve for EIC for HS and CS disaccharides from each sample were obtained from the raw LC-MS/MS data using qualitative analysis software (version B.06; Agilent Technologies). The obtained abundances for each disaccharide were first normalized to a spiked internal control (as indicated above) and then further normalized to a standard curve to obtain an absolute abundance of HS or CS disaccharides (fmol). A relative abundance was then calculated for each HS (supplemental File S1) and CS (supplemental File S2) disaccharides. For differentiating the isoforms, EIC (MS/MS) for diagnostic ions as indicated in (28) for each CS and HS disaccharide isoform was extracted, and abundance was obtained from manual area calculation. The obtained abundance was then used to calculate the percent relative abundance of each isoform which was further normalized using the MS/MS standard curve to obtain the percent absolute abundance of each HS or CS isoform.\nProtein Identification and Label-Free Quantification Using PEAKS Software\n        The raw LC-MS/MS data were converted into mzXML format using ProteoWizard msConvert (Version: 3.0.20210-c0fceb89a) (32). The data were searched using PeaksDB and PeaksPTM using Peaks Studio, version X+ (Bioinformatics Solutions, Inc) against the Uniprot/Swissprot database (release 2020_04) for homosapiens with a 1% false discovery rate and at least two unique peptides. False discovery rate (FDR) is estimated with the decoy fusion method, i.e., an enhanced target-decoy method using Peaks X+ software. A 10-ppm error tolerance for the precursor (MS1) and 0.02\u00a0Da mass error tolerance for fragment ions (MS2) were specified. A maximum of three missed cleavages per peptide was allowed for the database search, permitting nontryptic cleavage at one end. Trypsin was specified as the enzyme and carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification. The samples were tested for QC using PEAKS QC analysis; no significant difference with respect to protein, peptide MS1, MS2 trends, retention time, and precursor mass tolerance was observed for the samples indicating the high quality of the presented data (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S1). A peaksPTM search was queued after the peaksDB search, using advanced settings of a larger set of variable modifications, including hydroxylation P, oxidation M, hydroxylation K, hydroxylation-Hex K, hydroxylation-Hex-Hex K, HexNAc ST, HexHexNAc ST, phosphorylation STY, ubiquitination K, deamidation N, methoxy K, and nitrotyrosine Y. The final protein list generated was a combination of peaskDB and peaksPTM searches. The label-free quantification was achieved using the PEAKS Studio Quantification (PeaksQ)\u2014label-free module with a setting of mass error tolerance of 10\u00a0ppm and a retention time shift tolerance of 2.0\u00a0min. The identified protein, protein\u2013peptide, and peptide list from peaks PTM analysis are provided in supplemental File S3.\nMatrisome Analysis\n        The label-free exported \u201cproteins\u201d (supplemental File S4) and \u201cprotein\u2013peptide\u201d (supplemental File S5) comma-separated lists were filtered to include only matrisome components as identified by Naba et\u00a0al. (33), supplemental File S6; matrisome proteins, and supplemental File S7; matrisome protein\u2013peptide.\nStatistical Analysis and Visualization in RStudio and Microsoft Excel\n        The matrisome label-free quantified protein and their corresponding \u201cprotein\u2013peptide\u201d exports were used to compare the abundances of proteins and peptides between GBM and control samples and between GBM subtypes. Statistical analysis and visualization were carried out in RStudio (34). Heat maps of the log-transformed abundances of core matrisome components were generated using ggplot2. For statistical analysis, the compare means function was used with a FDR to correct for multiple comparisons (35). For visualization, boxplots of the log-transformed abundances of significantly differentially expressed proteins and peptides were generated. Further, the fold change and corresponding t-values were obtained by comparing normalized log-transformed protein and peptide abundances (FDR < 0.05) between various group comparisons, including GBM versus control, PRO/MES/CLA versus control, PRO versus MES, PRO versus CLA, and MES versus CLA analyses. The glycomics analysis was performed in Microsoft excel, and p-values were calculated by using heteroscedastic t test, and p-values < 0.05 were considered significant.\nGlycReSoft Analysis\n        Data were searched using the publicly available in-house GlycReSoft graphical user interface (desktop version) (36, 37) (https://github.com/BostonUniversityCBMS). A fasta glycopeptide hypothesis comprising the glycosylated and matrisomal proteins generated using UniProtKB (supplemental File S8) was used. A combinatorial glycan hypothesis was used to generate possible glycan compositions with the following rules: HexNAc 2-8, Hex 3-10, Fuc 0-5, NeuAc 0-4, HexNAc > Fuc, HexNAc - 1 > NeuAc. A list of identified total glycopeptides divided by sample number and intensity signal is provided in supplemental File S9. The identified glycopeptides corresponded to N-glycosites and Ser/Thr-O-glycosites. Three glycopeptides that corresponded to paucimannosidic N-glycosylation were detected in a few of the samples. These did not pass the RAMZIS score threshold as described in the next paragraph.\nGlycopeptide Similarity Analysis\n        The glycopeptides identified by GlycReSoft (supplemental File S9) were analyzed using RAMZIS, an R toolkit for assessing glycoproteomic data using contextual similarity (38). RAMZIS generates bootstrapped datasets to simulate comparisons that provide information on the consistency of the sample groups, their ability to be used in the comparison, the likelihood of a systemic difference, and the best candidates for further analysis. Using RAMZIS, each sample group was assessed for internal consistency and put into pairwise comparisons: the control was compared to an aggregate of the CLA, MES, and PRO subtypes as well as to each subtype on its own; the subtypes were similarly compared against each other. The following standards were used within the RAMZIS framework. For a dataset to be used in a comparison, it had to have an internal confidence score greater than 2, indicating that the internal similarity simulations, or internal similarity distribution, were on average more than two weighted standard deviations from the mean of the test similarity distribution. The test similarity distribution was only considered to reliably emulate the comparison if the original data comparison, or the Observed Similarity, was within the central two quartiles of the test distribution as a percentile or within two standard deviations of the test distribution mean; if it fell outside this region, then RAMZIS was not considered to emulate the comparison well. The general comparison was considered likely to find a systemic difference between the glycopeptide distributions if the test similarity distribution and null similarity distribution, the simulation of the null hypothesis of equivalent glycopeptide distributions, had a false positive overlap less than 0.05 or 5% and a false negative overlap less than 0.20 or 20%. Individual glycopeptides were reported with QCs that indicated if there were more than 25% overlap between their test and internal distributions, indicating the combined false positive and false negative rates; they were ranked according to the test distributions\u2019 separation to the respective null distributions with lower scores indicating a greater likelihood of a difference existing. These rankings were then assessed manually.\nGene Set Enrichment and Network Topology Analysis\n        The matrisome (supplemental File S10) differentially expressed protein and peptide lists (FDR < 0.05) for GBM versus control, and all subtypes comparisons were analyzed using WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt; http://www.webgestalt.org/) (39), for gene set enrichment (GSEA) and network topology analysis (NTA) to identify enriched GO terms (biological process, cellular component, molecular function, pathways, and networks specific to control and GBM subtypes).\nResults\n      \n        GAG Expression\n        Supplemental Table\u00a0S2 shows the Lawrence code nomenclature used here for the CS and HS disaccharides. The relative abundances calculation for CS (supplemental File S1) and HS disaccharides (supplemental File S2) are shown in Figure 1, A and B, respectively. The most abundant CS disaccharide for GBM and control samples was unsulfated D0a0, which was significantly elevated for GBM samples, specifically PRO subtype, as compared to controls. For the monosulfated disaccharides, 4-O-sulfated D0a4 was significantly decreased in GBM samples, specifically PRO and MES subtypes relative to the controls. On the other hand, 6-O-sulfated D0a6 was increased for GBM compared to control samples, with a notable increase in 6-O sulfation of CS for MES observed. For HS disaccharides, N-acetylated disaccharides were more abundant than N-sulfated for both GBM and control samples, and N-acetylated disaccharides were significantly increased, and N-sulfated disaccharides were significantly decreased for GBM versus control samples. Moreover, D0A0 disaccharide was dramatically the most abundant HS disaccharide in both GBM and control samples and significantly increased for GBM compared to control samples. Conversely, D0A6, i.e., HS 6-O sulfation, was significantly decreased for GBM compared to controls, which was an opposite expression to CS 6-O GalNAc sulfation. Some other significant differences for subtypes versus control HS disaccharides were observed, namely for D0A6, D2A0, and D2S0 disaccharides.Fig.\u00a01Disaccharides relative abundance. The relative abundance (%) for CS (A) and HS (B) disaccharides for proneural (PRO), mesenchymal (MES), and classical (CLA) GBM subtype, and control samples (left) and for GBM total (average of all subtypes) and control samples (right). For HS disaccharides %, relative abundance of N-acetylated (NA) versus N-sulfated (NS) is also provided for GBM subtypes and control (bottom left), and GBM total and control (bottom right) samples. Nomenclature for the Lawrence code are provided in supplemental Table\u00a0S1 (\u2217p \u2265 0.05, \u2217\u2217p \u2265 0.001, \u2217\u2217\u2217p \u2265 0.0001, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0\u2265 0.00001) (mean \u00b1 SD). CS, chondroitin sulfate; GBM, glioblastoma; HS, heparan sulfate.\n      \n      \n        Proteomics Analysis and Matrisome List Extraction\n        From the label-free proteomics analysis, 1280 proteins with \u22652 unique peptides (supplemental File S4) were quantified that corresponded to 28,522 peptides (spplemental File S5). The quantified protein list was then compared to the brain matrisome protein list from Naba et\u00a0al. (33), and a total of 146 matrisome-related proteins were filtered (supplemental File S6), comprising 75 core matrisome constituents, including PGs, glycoproteins, and collagens, and 71 matrisome-associated proteins including regulators, affiliated proteins, and secreted factors. Table\u00a02 shows accession and matrisome type for the 146 matrisomal proteins identified in this study.Table\u00a02List of core matrisome (left) and matrisome-associated proteins (right) as observed

       The quantified matrisomal protein and peptide list (supplemental Files S6 and S7) were analyzed in-depth to identify matrisomal changes within the three GBM subtypes (PRO versus CLA, PRO versus MES, CLA versus MES) and GBM and GBM subtypes versus control. A number of proteins and peptides (supplemental File S10) were observed to be differentially regulated (FDR < 0.05) between various group comparisons with a log2 fold change threshold of >1 or <\u00a0\u22121 as previously used for brain cohort studies (40). The top ten significantly increased or decreased proteins for GBM versus control, and their fold change values for GBM subtype versus control comparisons are presented in Table 3, and the normalized log-transformed abundances for top five increased and decreased proteins for GBM versus control are presented as box plots in Figure 2A and for GBM subtypes versus control in supplemental Fig.\u00a0S4. For GBM, 78 proteins were significantly increased, while eight proteins were decreased compared to the control samples. On the subtype level, PRO and MES subtype showed 41 and 25 proteins increased, and one and four proteins decreased, respectively, when compared to the control samples. Interestingly, the CLA subtype showed 12 proteins to be significantly increased while no proteins were significantly reduced as compared to the control samples. The fold changes for differentially expressed proteins in the GBM subtype versus control were observed to be higher than the GBM (all subtypes together) versus control comparisons. While the majority of the proteins were observed in higher abundances for GBM or GBM subtype samples relative to controls, only eight proteins were observed in higher abundances in controls, including leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1 (LGI1), tenascin R, hyaluronan proteoglycan link protein 1 and 2 (HAPLN1, HAPLN2), laminin subunit beta-2 (LAMB2), and decorin (DCN).Table\u00a03Differentially expressed proteins (FDR < 0.05) for top 10 increased (fold change > 1) and decreased proteins (fold change < 1) for GBM versus control and their fold change values for GBM subtype (PRO, MES, CLA) versus control comparisonsProteinsFold changeGBM versus ControlPRO versus ControlMES versus ControlCLA versus ControlTop-10 increased proteins\u00a0Von Willebrand factor A domain-containing protein 11.6190.1\u2212245.5\u00a0Adipocyte enhancer-binding protein 11.438.5\u2212\u2212\u00a0Prolargin1.327.6\u2212\u2212\u00a0Osteopontin1.3\u2212\u2212\u00a0Cathepsin Z1.319.626.8\u2212\u00a0Collagen alpha-1(XVI) chain1.214.611.1\u2212\u00a0Periostin1.2\u2212\u2212\u2212\u00a0Kininogen-11.212.5\u221215.6\u00a0Fibulin-51.2\u2212\u2212\u2212\u00a0Collagen alpha-2(VI) chain1.2\u2212\u2212\u2212Top-10 Decreased Proteins\u00a0Leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1\u22121.4\u2212\u2212\u00a0Hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 2\u22121.2\u2212\u2212\u00a0Protein S100-A1\u22121.1\u2212\u2212\u00a0Tenascin-R\u22121\u22123.2\u22124.8\u2212\u00a0Hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1\u22121\u2212\u22123.8\u2212\u00a0EMILIN-2\u22121\u2212\u2212\u2212\u00a0Laminin subunit beta-2\u22121\u2212\u22122.4\u2212\u00a0Decorin\u22121\u2212\u22122.7\u2212Abbreviations: CLA, classical; GBM, glioblastoma; MES, mesenchymal; PRO, proneural.Fig.\u00a02Differential expressed proteins.

FDR, false discovery rate; GBM, glioblastoma; IDH1, isocitrate dehydrogenase\u00a01.\n        Among the proteins observed at higher abundances in GBM relative to controls, we observed von Willebrand factor A domain-containing protein 1 (VWA1) to be about two-hundred-fold higher for PRO and CLA subtypes (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S4A). Notably, while tenascin R was increased for controls, tenascin (TNC) was increased for GBM samples (supplemental File S10). Several PGs, including prolargin (PRELP), agrin (AGRN), and biglycan (BGN), were elevated in GBM samples relative to controls. However, the abundances of lecticans such as versican (VCAN) and brevican (BCAN) were similar in GBM subtypes versus controls.\n        A number of blood coagulation related proteins, including VWA1, antithrombin III (ANT3), coagulation factor XIII A chain (F13A1), fibrinogen alpha chain (FIBA), fibrinogen beta chain (FIBB), and fibrinogen gamma chain (FIBG), were elevated for GBM samples (supplemental File S10), in comparison to the controls.\n        On comparison among GBM subtypes, cystatin B (CTSB) was elevated for PRO compared to MES and CLA subtype, and hemicentin-2 (HMCN2) and plexin-B1, which were increased and decreased for PRO versus CLA subtype, respectively (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S4B). No proteins were observed to be significantly altered for the CLA versus MES subtype comparison.\n        For peptide analysis (supplemental File S10), several N-deamidated and hydroxyprolinated (HPRO) peptides were increased in GBM versus control samples. Specifically, a number of HPRO peptides for collagens were found to be significantly elevated in GBM as compared to control samples. Several collagens were also increased at the protein level for GBM compared to the control samples. The degree of proline hydroxylation in collagen proteins was determined by dividing the number of hydroxylated proline residues by the total number of proline residues in a given peptide. A density plot was then generated showing the percentage of proline residues that are hydroxylated (Fig. 3). It was observed that control samples had far lesser HPRO peptide residues than GBM, which were mostly concentrated at 0% and a smaller cluster at 50%. In the GBM samples, the proline residues were commonly about 30% hydroxylated, but another hydroxylated cluster around 50% (the cluster for control at 50% was lower in density than GBM), and a smaller cluster at 100% was also observed. Further, we analyzed the differences in normalized abundances of HPRO peptides for various collagens observed in this study (supplemental File S11). Eight HPRO collagen proteins were significantly increased for GBM versus Control (Fig. 3). Among them, the collagen alpha-1(I) chain (CO1A1), collagen alpha-1(III) chain (CO1A3), and collagen alpha-2(IV) chain (CO4A2) were the top three most HPRO collagens. We then compared the abundances of each HPRO residue on these top-three collagens and observed a position-specific increase in HPRO in GBM versus Control (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S5). Abundances for all HPRO residues for eight significantly HPRO collagens are provided in supplemental File S12. We then explored the matrisome data to investigate the IDH-mutant versus WT and EGFR amplified versus unamplified status of the samples. 30 proteins were observed to be significantly (FDR < 0.05) lower in abundance for mutant IDH1 compared to the WT. Notably, two PGs, CSPG4 and agrin were significantly lower about 6-fold for IDH-mutant compared to the WT (Fig. 2B and supplemental File S10). No significantly regulated proteins were observed for EGFR amplified versus unamplified samples.Fig.\u00a03Collagen hydroxyprolination. Density plot showing proline hydroxylation of collagen peptides for GBM versus control (left). The x-axis shows the percentage of proline residues that are hydroxylated, and the y axis shows arbitrary units of density. The bar plots (right) show log-transformed normalized abundances for HPRO peptides for collagen proteins. Eight collagen proteins were significantly different in GBM versus control (\u2217p < 0.05, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, \u2217\u2217\u2217p < 0.001, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p < 0.0001). The normalized log-transformed abundances were corrected for multiple comparisons. GBM, glioblastoma.\n      \n      \n        Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and Network Topology Analysis\n        The differentially regulated proteins (supplemental File S10) for GBM versus control were then analyzed by GSEA and NTA, which uses the TCGA RNAseq GBM database. Interestingly, various cancer-related pathways, including pathways in cancer, ECM\u2013receptor interaction pathway, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, were among the enriched pathways (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S6A and supplemental File S13). Among gene ontology (GO) analysis, cell-substrate junction and endoplasmic reticulum were the most enriched cellular components for control and GBM samples. For biological processes, positive regulation of defense response and negative regulation of cell development and for molecular function, organic acid-binding and sulfur (GAG) compound binding were among the most enriched for control and GBM sample, respectively (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S6A). For NTA, WebGestalt uses a random walk method to compare the differentially regulated proteins in the present data with the TCGA RNAseq GBM database. The network for these along with enriched genes is shown ins. Using this analysis, we observed various enriched GO terms (red) in the network (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S6B), including important cancer-related biological processes such as ECM organization (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S6C), tumor development (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S6D), and cell adhesion (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S6E). To summarize, a number of cancer-related and GBM-related pathways and GO terms were observed enriched in our matrisome data, highlighting the connection of matrisome and GBM.\n      \n      \n        Glycoproteomics Similarity Analysis\n        The raw data were searched using the publicly available in-house GlycReSoft user interface (desktop version) (27, 28), using a fasta file generated from UniProtKB (supplemental File S8) comprising of N- and O-glycosylated proteins and matrisomal proteins. GlycReSoft provided a list of 532 glycopeptides observed across the samples (supplemental File S9). The intensity of these glycopeptides was log-transformed and then analyzed using RAMZIS, an R toolkit for assessing glycoproteomic data using contextual similarity (38). For the analysis, a filter of glycopeptides present in at least two biological replicates was applied that yielded 198 (GBM versus control), 147 (Pro versus control), 91 (MES versus control), 136 (CLA versus control), 151 (CLA versus PRO), 121 (CLA versus MES), and 129 (PRO versus MES) glycopeptides for different comparisons performed. The null and test hypothesis ranking and internal distribution ranking with z-scores for various comparisons are provided in supplemental Files S14 and S15, respectively.\n        For GBM versus control comparison, both internal similarity distributions (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S7, A and B) had confidence scores above 2, indicating a less than 2.2% chance of the internal and test similarity distributions being equivalent and allowing us to reject the null hypothesis that they were equivalent. Both have negligible overlap between the internal and test. The internal similarity variance of control samples was equivalent to the other independent groups, which supported our conclusions despite the dependence within the control sample because the group variance was roughly equivalent to the sample variance. As a metric of simulation functionality and reasonability, the observed similarity was placed within the test distribution as a percentile; for GBM versus control similarity comparison (Fig. 4A), the observed similarity was in the 72nd percentile of the test distribution, making it well within two standard deviations of the mean and within the two center quartiles, passing the quality metrics (see Glycopeptide Similarity Analysis method section for details). There was negligible overlap between the test and null hypotheses, and we rejected the Null hypothesis that the test and null were equivalent; the glycosylation patterns were not being sampled from the same underlying distribution. The quality of the data and the separation allowed us to conclude the differences between the glycosylation patterns between the control and GBM samples (supplemental File S15).Fig.\u00a04Similarity plots using RAMZIS. The modified Tanimoto similarity metric is represented on the x-axis, and the y-axis represents the percent of similarity distribution present at a given similarity. The observed similarity is represented by the solid vertical black line. As a metric of simulation functionality and reasonability, the observed similarity is placed within the test distribution as a percentile; an observed similarity within two standard deviations of the mean and within the two center quartiles passes the quality metrics. The test and null distributions are represented in red and blue colors, respectively. The gray shaded region within the comparisons represent the overlap of the two distributions that can be perceived as a false negative observation, wherein it is possible to observe a nontest similarity comparison but more likely for it to be a test similarity comparison; the black shaded region is considered false positives with a test observation possible, but a nontest observation being more likely. We accept up to a 20% false negative rate and a 5% false positive rate in line with other statistical standards. The observed similarity should be within the central quartiles (25%\u201375%) if RAMZIS has correctly simulated the data. Internal Similarity Confidence scores (IS) should be greater than 2, indicating a less than 3% chance that the internal and test similarity means could be conflated. Ideal similarity distributions are tightly defined with minimal tails; broader distributions indicate less reproducible similarity comparisons. A, GBM versus control. B,\u00a0PRO versus control. C, MES versus control. D, CLA versus control; E, MES versus PRO. F, CLA versus MES. G, CLA versus PRO. H, GBM no CLA versus control. CLA, classical; GBM, glioblastoma; MES, mesenchymal; PRO, proneural.\n        The comparison of PRO versus control (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S8, A and B) had high internal similarity with high confidence. We concluded from the RAMZIS similarity comparison of PRO versus control (Fig. 4B) that we could reject the null hypothesis; control and PRO did not sample from the same underlying distribution. Thus, control and PRO were reliably differentiated in glycosylation patterns. Similar profiles were observed for MES versus control (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S8, C and D) and Figure 4C.\n        For the CLA versus control subtype, the internal similarity comparison remained confident for this comparison, but the internal of the CLA group score fell below the confidence threshold of 2 (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S8, E and F). CLA also had a 3.4% false negative rate and a 0.2% false positive rate for the internal comparison. This indicated that members of the CLA subtype may have overlapped with the control group, and there was not a high enough degree of reproducibility in the CLA subtype to produce a reliable comparison. For the CLA versus control CLA similarity comparison (Fig. 4D), the observed similarity fell within acceptable bounds, but due to the CLA subtype's poor internal data quality, we could not draw a conclusion.\n        For the GBM versus control without the CLA subtype, both the internal similarities were sufficiently confident to draw conclusions with scores over 2 (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S7, C and D). The observed similarity (Fig.\u00a04H) was within the central quartiles and two standard deviations of the mean of the test similarity. The quality of the data and the separation indicated there were differences in the glycosylation patterns between the control and GBM subtypes. There was a slight change in the internal confidence scores of this comparison compared to the comparison between the control and all GBM subtypes; the decrease in the internal of the control likely stems from the increased similarity of the test comparison overall, as the control group itself is not different from the original comparison. The increase in the internal confidence of the GBM group stemmed from the absence of CLA, which must have less in common with PRO and MES than they did with one another or was much more variant than them; further comparisons suggest that CLA was much more variant. The increase in confidence was subtle but strong enough to work counter to the increased similarity in the test comparison.\n        For CLA versus MES (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S9, A and B and Fig.\u00a04F) and CLA versus PRO (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S9, C and D and Fig.\u00a04G) comparisons, CLA continued to have too poor data quality to indicate with confidence if there were any differences in glycosylation pattern in these comparisons, although general comparison showed evidence to reject the null hypothesis if there were stronger data for CLA subtype. The comparison of CLA versus PRO showed an increase in test similarity, indicating the two had more similar glycosylation patterns; due to CLA\u2019s high internal variance and PRO\u2019s lower degree of internal variance, as indicated by their internal similarity distributions, PRO may be a more well-regulated subset of the CLA subtype in regards to glycosylation. At the least, this suggested that the glycosylation of PRO had more in common with CLA than any other experimental group examined here. This was further confirmed in MES versus PRO (supplemental Fig. S9E and F, and Fig. 4E), where both MES and PRO had high internal confidences, an observed similarity in the central quartiles of the test distribution and false-positive and negative rates under our thresholds to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, MES and PRO were reliably differentiated in glycosylation patterns.\n      \n      \n        Glycoproteomics Analysis\n        Based on the results of similarity analysis, we filtered ranked glycopeptides based on dissimilarity for the group comparisons using z scores cutoff of\u00a0\u22121 (supplemental File S16). Further, we selected only those glycopeptides which were observed in both the groups (highlighted; as indicated by TRUE; NA means not observed in a group) to remove any false positive difference and provide reliable differentiable patterns and glycopeptides with high confidence. Using these criteria, we found 17 glycopeptides dissimilar between different group comparisons, including GBM versus control, GBM (no CLA) versus control, PRO versus control, MES versus control, CLA versus control, MES versus PRO, CLA versus PRO, and CLA versus MES. Notably, many of these glycopeptides belonged to PGs, including BCAN (S625, T590), VCAN (T937, T939), and AGRN (T1335). Interestingly, most of the glycopeptides were reduced in GBM (with or without CLA) or GBM subtypes, except sialylated O-glycopeptide at site T590, which was higher for both GBM (no CLA) and PRO subtype versus control samples, indicating the elevation of sialylation in GBM. In addition, N-glycopeptides for neuronal cell adhesion molecule at sites N908 and N996 were also reduced for GBM (no CLA), MES, and CLA subtypes versus controls. Furthermore, two O-glycopeptide at T937 and T939 for VCAN were elevated for MES versus PRO subtype (Table\u00a04). On the other hand, O-glycopeptide at T1335 for AGRN was elevated for PRO versus MES. CLA subtype showed lower glycopeptide intensity compared to MES and PRO subtype, which could also be attributed to poor quality data, as explained in the previous section. However, one sialylated N-glycopeptide (N129) belonging to fibrinogen gamma showed a 10-fold higher intensity for MES than the CLA subtype.

Specifically, dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide\u2013protein glycosyltransferase subunit STT3A and dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide\u2013protein glycosyltransferase subunit STT3B were about 120- and 43-fold increased for GBM versus controls, indicating higher glycosylation in GBM. A similar increase in STT3A was observed for PRO subtype versus control samples. In addition, other glycosyltransferases, including beta-1 3-glucosyltransferase, mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase beta, and dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide\u2013protein glycosyltransferase subunit one and two were also increased for GBM versus control samples (supplemental File S10). Notably, glycosidase enzymes including mannosyl-oligosaccharide glucosidase, glucosidase two subunit beta, and neutral alpha-glucosidase AB were elevated for GBM samples; specifically, PRO and MES subtypes compared to control samples (supplemental File S10), indicating an increase in maturation and processing of high mannose N-glycans to complex N-glycans in GBM.\nGAG Expression\n        Supplemental Table\u00a0S2 shows the Lawrence code nomenclature used here for the CS and HS disaccharides. The relative abundances calculation for CS (supplemental File S1) and HS disaccharides (supplemental File S2) are shown in Figure 1, A and B, respectively. The most abundant CS disaccharide for GBM and control samples was unsulfated D0a0, which was significantly elevated for GBM samples, specifically PRO subtype, as compared to controls. For the monosulfated disaccharides, 4-O-sulfated D0a4 was significantly decreased in GBM samples, specifically PRO and MES subtypes relative to the controls. On the other hand, 6-O-sulfated D0a6 was increased for GBM compared to control samples, with a notable increase in 6-O sulfation of CS for MES observed. For HS disaccharides, N-acetylated disaccharides were more abundant than N-sulfated for both GBM and control samples, and N-acetylated disaccharides were significantly increased, and N-sulfated disaccharides were significantly decreased for GBM versus control samples. Moreover, D0A0 disaccharide was dramatically the most abundant HS disaccharide in both GBM and control samples and significantly increased for GBM compared to control samples. Conversely, D0A6, i.e., HS 6-O sulfation, was significantly decreased for GBM compared to controls, which was an opposite expression to CS 6-O GalNAc sulfation. Some other significant differences for subtypes versus control HS disaccharides were observed, namely for D0A6, D2A0, and D2S0 disaccharides.Fig.\u00a01Disaccharides relative abundance.

The quantified protein list was then compared to the brain matrisome protein list from Naba et\u00a0al. (33), and a total of 146 matrisome-related proteins were filtered (supplemental File S6), comprising 75 core matrisome constituents, including PGs, glycoproteins, and collagens, and 71 matrisome-associated proteins including regulators, affiliated proteins, and secreted factors.

matrisomal protein and peptide list (supplemental Files S6 and S7) were analyzed in-depth to identify matrisomal changes within the three GBM subtypes (PRO versus CLA, PRO versus MES, CLA versus MES) and GBM and GBM subtypes versus control. A number of proteins and peptides (supplemental File S10) were observed to be differentially regulated (FDR < 0.05) between various group comparisons with a log2 fold change threshold of >1 or <\u00a0\u22121 as previously used for brain cohort studies (40). The top ten significantly increased or decreased proteins for GBM versus control, and their fold change values for GBM subtype versus control comparisons are presented in Table 3, and the normalized log-transformed abundances for top five increased and decreased proteins for GBM versus control are presented as box plots in Figure 2A and for GBM subtypes versus control in supplemental Fig.\u00a0S4. For GBM, 78 proteins were significantly increased, while eight proteins were decreased compared to the control samples. On the subtype level, PRO and MES subtype showed 41 and 25 proteins increased, and one and four proteins decreased, respectively, when compared to the control samples. Interestingly, the CLA subtype showed 12 proteins to be significantly increased while no proteins were significantly reduced as compared to the control samples. The fold changes for differentially expressed proteins in the GBM subtype versus control were observed to be higher than the GBM (all subtypes together) versus control comparisons. While the majority of the proteins were observed in higher abundances for GBM or GBM subtype samples relative to controls, only eight proteins were observed in higher abundances in controls, including leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1 (LGI1), tenascin R, hyaluronan proteoglycan link protein 1 and 2 (HAPLN1, HAPLN2), laminin subunit beta-2 (LAMB2), and decorin (DCN).Table\u00a03Differentially expressed proteins (FDR < 0.05) for top 10 increased (fold change > 1) and decreased proteins (fold change < 1) for GBM versus control and their fold change values for GBM subtype (PRO, MES, CLA) versus control comparisonsProteinsFold changeGBM versus ControlPRO versus ControlMES versus ControlCLA versus ControlTop-10 increased proteins\u00a0Von Willebrand factor A domain-containing protein 11.6190.1\u2212245.5\u00a0Adipocyte enhancer-binding protein 11.438.5\u2212\u2212\u00a0Prolargin1.327.6\u2212\u2212\u00a0Osteopontin1.3\u2212\u2212\u00a0Cathepsin Z1.319.626.8\u2212\u00a0Collagen alpha-1(XVI) chain1.214.611.1\u2212\u00a0Periostin1.2\u2212\u2212\u2212\u00a0Kininogen-11.212.5\u221215.6\u00a0Fibulin-51.2\u2212\u2212\u2212\u00a0Collagen alpha-2(VI) chain1.2\u2212\u2212\u2212Top-10 Decreased Proteins\u00a0Leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1\u22121.4\u2212\u2212\u00a0Hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 2\u22121.2\u2212\u2212\u00a0Protein S100-A1\u22121.1\u2212\u2212\u00a0Tenascin-R\u22121\u22123.2\u22124.8\u2212\u00a0Hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1\u22121\u2212\u22123.8\u2212\u00a0EMILIN-2\u22121\u2212\u2212\u2212\u00a0Laminin subunit beta-2\u22121\u2212\u22122.4\u2212\u00a0Decorin\u22121\u2212\u22122.7\u2212Abbreviations: CLA, classical; GBM, glioblastoma; MES, mesenchymal; PRO, proneural.Fig.\u00a02Differential expressed proteins.

FDR, false discovery rate; GBM, glioblastoma; IDH1, isocitrate dehydrogenase\u00a01.\n        Among the proteins observed at higher abundances in GBM relative to controls, we observed von Willebrand factor A domain-containing protein 1 (VWA1) to be about two-hundred-fold higher for PRO and CLA subtypes (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S4A). Notably, while tenascin R was increased for controls, tenascin (TNC) was increased for GBM samples (supplemental File S10). Several PGs, including prolargin (PRELP), agrin (AGRN), and biglycan (BGN), were elevated in GBM samples relative to controls. However, the abundances of lecticans such as versican (VCAN) and brevican (BCAN) were similar in GBM subtypes versus controls.\n        A number of blood coagulation related proteins, including VWA1, antithrombin III (ANT3), coagulation factor XIII A chain (F13A1), fibrinogen alpha chain (FIBA), fibrinogen beta chain (FIBB), and fibrinogen gamma chain (FIBG), were elevated for GBM samples (supplemental File S10), in comparison to the controls.\n        On comparison among GBM subtypes, cystatin B (CTSB) was elevated for PRO compared to MES and CLA subtype, and hemicentin-2 (HMCN2) and plexin-B1, which were increased and decreased for PRO versus CLA subtype, respectively (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S4B). No proteins were observed to be significantly altered for the CLA versus MES subtype comparison.\n        For peptide analysis (supplemental File S10), several N-deamidated and hydroxyprolinated (HPRO) peptides were increased in GBM versus control samples. Specifically, a number of HPRO peptides for collagens were found to be significantly elevated in GBM as compared to control samples. Several collagens were also increased at the protein level for GBM compared to the control samples. The degree of proline hydroxylation in collagen proteins was determined by dividing the number of hydroxylated proline residues by the total number of proline residues in a given peptide. A density plot was then generated showing the percentage of proline residues that are hydroxylated (Fig. 3). It was observed that control samples had far lesser HPRO peptide residues than GBM, which were mostly concentrated at 0% and a smaller cluster at 50%. In the GBM samples, the proline residues were commonly about 30% hydroxylated, but another hydroxylated cluster around 50% (the cluster for control at 50% was lower in density than GBM), and a smaller cluster at 100% was also observed. Further, we analyzed the differences in normalized abundances of HPRO peptides for various collagens observed in this study (supplemental File S11). Eight HPRO collagen proteins were significantly increased for GBM versus Control (Fig. 3). Among them, the collagen alpha-1(I) chain (CO1A1), collagen alpha-1(III) chain (CO1A3), and collagen alpha-2(IV) chain (CO4A2) were the top three most HPRO collagens. We then compared the abundances of each HPRO residue on these top-three collagens and observed a position-specific increase in HPRO in GBM versus Control (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S5). Abundances for all HPRO residues for eight significantly HPRO collagens are provided in supplemental File S12. We then explored the matrisome data to investigate the IDH-mutant versus WT and EGFR amplified versus unamplified status of the samples. 30 proteins were observed to be significantly (FDR < 0.05) lower in abundance for mutant IDH1 compared to the WT. Notably, two PGs, CSPG4 and agrin were significantly lower about 6-fold for IDH-mutant compared to the WT (Fig. 2B and supplemental File S10). No significantly regulated proteins were observed for EGFR amplified versus unamplified samples.Fig.\u00a03Collagen hydroxyprolination. Density plot showing proline hydroxylation of collagen peptides for GBM versus control (left). The x-axis shows the percentage of proline residues that are hydroxylated, and the y axis shows arbitrary units of density. The bar plots (right) show log-transformed normalized abundances for HPRO peptides for collagen proteins. Eight collagen proteins were significantly different in GBM versus control (\u2217p < 0.05, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, \u2217\u2217\u2217p < 0.001, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p < 0.0001). The normalized log-transformed abundances were corrected for multiple comparisons. GBM, glioblastoma.\nGene Set Enrichment Analysis and Network Topology Analysis\n        The differentially regulated proteins (supplemental File S10) for GBM versus control were then analyzed by GSEA and NTA, which uses the TCGA RNAseq GBM database. Interestingly, various cancer-related pathways, including pathways in cancer, ECM\u2013receptor interaction pathway, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, were among the enriched pathways (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S6A and supplemental File S13). Among gene ontology (GO) analysis, cell-substrate junction and endoplasmic reticulum were the most enriched cellular components for control and GBM samples. For biological processes, positive regulation of defense response and negative regulation of cell development and for molecular function, organic acid-binding and sulfur (GAG) compound binding were among the most enriched for control and GBM sample, respectively (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S6A). For NTA, WebGestalt uses a random walk method to compare the differentially regulated proteins in the present data with the TCGA RNAseq GBM database. The network for these along with enriched genes is shown ins. Using this analysis, we observed various enriched GO terms (red) in the network (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S6B), including important cancer-related biological processes such as ECM organization (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S6C), tumor development (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S6D), and cell adhesion (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S6E). To summarize, a number of cancer-related and GBM-related pathways and GO terms were observed enriched in our matrisome data, highlighting the connection of matrisome and GBM.\nGlycoproteomics Similarity Analysis\n        The raw data were searched using the publicly available in-house GlycReSoft user interface (desktop version) (27, 28), using a fasta file generated from UniProtKB (supplemental File S8) comprising of N- and O-glycosylated proteins and matrisomal proteins. GlycReSoft provided a list of 532 glycopeptides observed across the samples (supplemental File S9). The intensity of these glycopeptides was log-transformed and then analyzed using RAMZIS, an R toolkit for assessing glycoproteomic data using contextual similarity (38). For the analysis, a filter of glycopeptides present in at least two biological replicates was applied that yielded 198 (GBM versus control), 147 (Pro versus control), 91 (MES versus control), 136 (CLA versus control), 151 (CLA versus PRO), 121 (CLA versus MES), and 129 (PRO versus MES) glycopeptides for different comparisons performed. The null and test hypothesis ranking and internal distribution ranking with z-scores for various comparisons are provided in supplemental Files S14 and S15, respectively.\n        For GBM versus control comparison, both internal similarity distributions (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S7, A and B) had confidence scores above 2, indicating a less than 2.2% chance of the internal and test similarity distributions being equivalent and allowing us to reject the null hypothesis that they were equivalent. Both have negligible overlap between the internal and test. The internal similarity variance of control samples was equivalent to the other independent groups, which supported our conclusions despite the dependence within the control sample because the group variance was roughly equivalent to the sample variance. As a metric of simulation functionality and reasonability, the observed similarity was placed within the test distribution as a percentile; for GBM versus control similarity comparison (Fig. 4A), the observed similarity was in the 72nd percentile of the test distribution, making it well within two standard deviations of the mean and within the two center quartiles, passing the quality metrics (see Glycopeptide Similarity Analysis method section for details). There was negligible overlap between the test and null hypotheses, and we rejected the Null hypothesis that the test and null were equivalent; the glycosylation patterns were not being sampled from the same underlying distribution. The quality of the data and the separation allowed us to conclude the differences between the glycosylation patterns between the control and GBM samples (supplemental File S15).Fig.\u00a04Similarity plots using RAMZIS. The modified Tanimoto similarity metric is represented on the x-axis, and the y-axis represents the percent of similarity distribution present at a given similarity. The observed similarity is represented by the solid vertical black line. As a metric of simulation functionality and reasonability, the observed similarity is placed within the test distribution as a percentile; an observed similarity within two standard deviations of the mean and within the two center quartiles passes the quality metrics. The test and null distributions are represented in red and blue colors, respectively. The gray shaded region within the comparisons represent the overlap of the two distributions that can be perceived as a false negative observation, wherein it is possible to observe a nontest similarity comparison but more likely for it to be a test similarity comparison; the black shaded region is considered false positives with a test observation possible, but a nontest observation being more likely. We accept up to a 20% false negative rate and a 5% false positive rate in line with other statistical standards. The observed similarity should be within the central quartiles (25%\u201375%) if RAMZIS has correctly simulated the data. Internal Similarity Confidence scores (IS) should be greater than 2, indicating a less than 3% chance that the internal and test similarity means could be conflated. Ideal similarity distributions are tightly defined with minimal tails; broader distributions indicate less reproducible similarity comparisons. A, GBM versus control. B,\u00a0PRO versus control. C, MES versus control. D, CLA versus control; E, MES versus PRO. F, CLA versus MES. G, CLA versus PRO. H, GBM no CLA versus control. CLA, classical; GBM, glioblastoma; MES, mesenchymal; PRO, proneural.\n        The comparison of PRO versus control (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S8, A and B) had high internal similarity with high confidence. We concluded from the RAMZIS similarity comparison of PRO versus control (Fig. 4B) that we could reject the null hypothesis; control and PRO did not sample from the same underlying distribution. Thus, control and PRO were reliably differentiated in glycosylation patterns. Similar profiles were observed for MES versus control (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S8, C and D) and Figure 4C.\n        For the CLA versus control subtype, the internal similarity comparison remained confident for this comparison, but the internal of the CLA group score fell below the confidence threshold of 2 (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S8, E and F). CLA also had a 3.4% false negative rate and a 0.2% false positive rate for the internal comparison. This indicated that members of the CLA subtype may have overlapped with the control group, and there was not a high enough degree of reproducibility in the CLA subtype to produce a reliable comparison. For the CLA versus control CLA similarity comparison (Fig. 4D), the observed similarity fell within acceptable bounds, but due to the CLA subtype's poor internal data quality, we could not draw a conclusion.\n        For the GBM versus control without the CLA subtype, both the internal similarities were sufficiently confident to draw conclusions with scores over 2 (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S7, C and D). The observed similarity (Fig.\u00a04H) was within the central quartiles and two standard deviations of the mean of the test similarity. The quality of the data and the separation indicated there were differences in the glycosylation patterns between the control and GBM subtypes. There was a slight change in the internal confidence scores of this comparison compared to the comparison between the control and all GBM subtypes; the decrease in the internal of the control likely stems from the increased similarity of the test comparison overall, as the control group itself is not different from the original comparison. The increase in the internal confidence of the GBM group stemmed from the absence of CLA, which must have less in common with PRO and MES than they did with one another or was much more variant than them; further comparisons suggest that CLA was much more variant. The increase in confidence was subtle but strong enough to work counter to the increased similarity in the test comparison.\n        For CLA versus MES (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S9, A and B and Fig.\u00a04F) and CLA versus PRO (supplemental Fig.\u00a0S9, C and D and Fig.\u00a04G) comparisons, CLA continued to have too poor data quality to indicate with confidence if there were any differences in glycosylation pattern in these comparisons, although general comparison showed evidence to reject the null hypothesis if there were stronger data for CLA subtype. The comparison of CLA versus PRO showed an increase in test similarity, indicating the two had more similar glycosylation patterns; due to CLA\u2019s high internal variance and PRO\u2019s lower degree of internal variance, as indicated by their internal similarity distributions, PRO may be a more well-regulated subset of the CLA subtype in regards to glycosylation. At the least, this suggested that the glycosylation of PRO had more in common with CLA than any other experimental group examined here. This was further confirmed in MES versus PRO (supplemental Fig. S9E and F, and Fig. 4E), where both MES and PRO had high internal confidences, an observed similarity in the central quartiles of the test distribution and false-positive and negative rates under our thresholds to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, MES and PRO were reliably differentiated in glycosylation patterns.\nGlycoproteomics Analysis\n        Based on the results of similarity analysis, we filtered ranked glycopeptides based on dissimilarity for the group comparisons using z scores cutoff of\u00a0\u22121 (supplemental File S16). Further, we selected only those glycopeptides which were observed in both the groups (highlighted; as indicated by TRUE; NA means not observed in a group) to remove any false positive difference and provide reliable differentiable patterns and glycopeptides with high confidence. Using these criteria, we found 17 glycopeptides dissimilar between different group comparisons, including GBM versus control, GBM (no CLA) versus control, PRO versus control, MES versus control, CLA versus control, MES versus PRO, CLA versus PRO, and CLA versus MES. Notably, many of these glycopeptides belonged to PGs, including BCAN (S625, T590), VCAN (T937, T939), and AGRN (T1335). Interestingly, most of the glycopeptides were reduced in GBM (with or without CLA) or GBM subtypes, except sialylated O-glycopeptide at site T590, which was higher for both GBM (no CLA) and PRO subtype versus control samples, indicating the elevation of sialylation in GBM. In addition, N-glycopeptides for neuronal cell adhesion molecule at sites N908 and N996 were also reduced for GBM (no CLA), MES, and CLA subtypes versus controls. Furthermore, two O-glycopeptide at T937 and T939 for VCAN were elevated for MES versus PRO subtype (Table\u00a04). On the other hand, O-glycopeptide at T1335 for AGRN was elevated for PRO versus MES. CLA subtype showed lower glycopeptide intensity compared to MES and PRO subtype, which could also be attributed to poor quality data, as explained in the previous section. However, one sialylated N-glycopeptide (N129) belonging to fibrinogen gamma showed a 10-fold higher intensity for MES than the CLA subtype. The tandem mass spectra for all these glycopeptides are shown in Supplemental File S17.Table\u00a04Filtered ranked glycopeptides based on dissimilarity for the group comparisons using z scores cutoff of\u00a0\u22121 and observed in both the groups, their associated proteins, average intensities for Group 1 and Group 2, and direction of change for Group 1 versus 2 (increased or decreased in Group 1)Comparison Group 1 versus Group 2GlycopeptideProteinAverage intensity Group 1Average intensity Group 2Direction of change for Group 1 versus Group 2GBM versus ControlEVGEATGGPELS(O-Glycosylation)GVPR{Hex:1; HexNAc:1; Neu5Ac:1}Q96GW7|PGCB_HUMAN Brevican core protein4149179.80913700681.18\u2193GBM versus ControlVHGPPT(O-Glycosylation)ETLPTPR{Hex:2; HexNAc:2}Q96GW7|PGCB_HUMAN Brevican core protein6489435.88714198380.17\u2193GBM (no CLA) versus ControlVHGPPT(O-Glycosylation)ETLPTPR{Hex:2; HexNAc:2; Neu5Ac:1}Q96GW7|PGCB_HUMAN Brevican core protein17032540.091732376.149\u2191GBM (no CLA) versus ControlVNVVN(N-Glycosylation)STLAEVHWDPVPLK{Hex:5; HexNAc:2}Q92823|NRCAM_HUMAN Neuronal cell adhesion molecule746852.57722514727.657\u2193PRO versus ControlVHGPPT(O-Glycosylation)ETLPTPR{Hex:2; HexNAc:2; Neu5Ac:1}Q96GW7|PGCB_HUMAN Brevican core protein24156172.471732376.149\u2191PRO versus ControlGSLSYLN(N-Glycosylation)VTR{Hex:5; HexNAc:2}P07339|CATD_HUMAN Cathepsin D1188954.93111732037.79\u2193PRO versus ControlGSLSYLN(N-Glycosylation)VTR{Hex:6; HexNAc:2} }P07339|CATD_HUMAN Cathepsin D2380641.71514259589.44\u2193MES versus ControlVNVVN(N-Glycosylation)STLAEVHWDPVPLK{Hex:5; HexNAc:2}Q92823|NRCAM_HUMAN Neuronal cell adhesion molecule2091187.2162514727.657\u2193CLA versus ControlFN(N-Glycosylation)HTQTIQQK{Hex:5; HexNAc:2}Q92823|NRCAM_HUMAN Neuronal cell adhesion molecule2962900.07436541412.68\u2193CLA versus ControlLLNINPN(N-Glycosylation)KT{Hex:5; HexNAc:2}P11279|LAMP1_HUMAN Lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 11271305.8710969186.96\u2193MES versus PROFQPTTST(O-Glycosylation)GIAEK{Hex:4; HexNAc:4}P13611|CSPG2_HUMAN Versican core protein2504868.9432780108.302\u2193MES versus PROFQPTT(O-Glycosylation)STGIAEK{Hex:4; HexNAc:4}P13611|CSPG2_HUMAN Versican core protein2504868.942780108.3023\u2193MES versus PROLPSSAVT(O-Glycosylation)PR{HexNAc:2}O00468|AGRIN_HUMAN Agrin9163338.0253284955.444\u2191CLA versus PROLLNINPN(N-Glycosylation)K{Hex:5; HexNAc:2}P11279|LAMP1_HUMAN Lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 14037102.8591165363.714\u2191CLA versus PROTFVLSALQPSPTHSS(O-Glycosylation)SNTQR{Hex:1; HexNAc:1; Neu5Ac:1}P19827|ITIH1_HUMAN Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H12836091.6381161018.844\u2191CLA versus MESEEQFNS(O-Glycosylation)TFR{Fuc:1; Hex:4; HexNAc:4}P01859|IGHG2_HUMAN Immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma 250183304.313546469.66\u2191CLA versus MESDLQSLEDILHQVEN(N-Glycosylation)K{Hex:5; HexNAc:4; Neu5Ac:1}P02679|FIBG_HUMAN Fibrinogen gamma chain180503261.115778062.01\u2191Abbreviations: CLA, classical; GBM, glioblastoma; MES, mesenchymal; PRO, proneural.\n        We further investigated the expression of glycosylation enzymes (glycosyltransferase/glycosidase) in GBM and GBM subtype versus control samples (Fig.\u00a02C and supplemental File S10). Strikingly, a significant increase in glycosylation enzymes (FDR < 0.05) was observed in GBM versus controls (Fig.\u00a02C). Specifically, dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide\u2013protein glycosyltransferase subunit STT3A and dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide\u2013protein glycosyltransferase subunit STT3B were about 120- and 43-fold increased for GBM versus controls, indicating higher glycosylation in GBM. A similar increase in STT3A was observed for PRO subtype versus control samples. In addition, other glycosyltransferases, including beta-1 3-glucosyltransferase, mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase beta, and dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide\u2013protein glycosyltransferase subunit one and two were also increased for GBM versus control samples (supplemental File S10). Notably, glycosidase enzymes including mannosyl-oligosaccharide glucosidase, glucosidase two subunit beta, and neutral alpha-glucosidase AB were elevated for GBM samples; specifically, PRO and MES subtypes compared to control samples (supplemental File S10), indicating an increase in maturation and processing of high mannose N-glycans to complex N-glycans in GBM.\nDiscussion\n      Altered protein and gene expression in GBM using proteomics and genomic techniques are well-documented, but glycomics and glycoproteomics investigation in GBM is underexplored. This study provided an in-depth glycomics, proteomics, and glycoproteomics analysis of GBM subtypes and control samples with a special focus on matrisome. The aim was to achieve a comprehensive understanding of matrisome molecules, including PGs and GAGs in GBM tumorigenesis, to better understand the disease pathogenesis and identify clinical markers.\n      For the study, we utilized our state-of-the-art on-slide tissue digestion method and extracted various GAGs (CS and HS disaccharides) followed by peptides using appropriate enzymes from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded TMAs. The tumors were assigned GBM subtypes based on genome patterns: 11 CLA, nine MES, and 19 PRO. Additionally, four control tissue samples were used, making a total of 43 samples.\n      We first analyzed the CS and HS disaccharides extracted from GBM and control samples. CS and HS GAGs may directly promote tumor cell adhesion, proliferation, and invasion, causing a more aggressive form of brain cancer (41, 42). Moreover, changes in GAG sulfation patterns play an essential role in physiological processes in various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders (43). Importantly, aberrant accumulation of CS has been seen in ECM glioma (44). Chondroitin sulfate synthase 1, CS polymerization enzyme, has been significantly upregulated in GBM compared to normal brain tissue, and chondroitin sulfate synthase 1 mediates the increase of 6-O sulfation of CS in human glioma (44), supporting our finding of elevated 6-O CS sulfation in GBM samples. In addition, both 4-O sulfation and 6-O sulfation have been observed in human glioma cells that could be used as a possible target in glioma therapy (45). We observed increased unsulfated CS and HS disaccharides for GBM compared to normal samples. An increase in extracellular sulfatase (SULF1 and SULF2) in human GBM regulates important interactions of growth factors and ECM components to PGs, thus mediating tumor cell invasion (46) and proliferation (47). The sulfatase enzyme selectively cleaves HS 6-O sulfation, thus indicating a lower HS 6-O sulfation in GBM as observed in this study (41, 46). Congruent with our observation, an increase in CS 6-O sulfation, increase in HS unsulfation, and decrease in HS 6-O sulfation was observed in breast cancer (48). These changes in the HS sulfation pattern result in high heparanase expression which in turn degrades the ECM and facilitates metastasis (43, 48). We also observed specific GAG disaccharide features for GBM subtypes which have not been reported before; however, a previous study has reported differences in SULF1 and SULF2 enzyme level between GBM subtypes (10). Thus, our findings in concordance with previous studies point toward the therapeutic potential of GAGs in GBM.\n      We further analyzed the matrisome protein and peptide expression. Several core matrisome-related proteins were observed among differentially expressed proteins, majority of them increased, while only five were reduced in GBM, including TNR, HAPLN1, HAPLN2, DCN, and LAMB2. TNR has been observed to decrease for highly malignant cancer (49). On the contrary, the increased expression of DCN has been reported in GBM tumors negatively associated with the overall survival rate of GBM patients (50). Reduction in HAPLNs in malignant gliomas has been previously observed. CSPGs in the normal brain interact with tenascins, HAPLNs, and other glycoproteins to form matrix scaffolds and ECM aggregates around subsets of neurons, known as perineuronal nets, which are associated with reduced neuronal cell motility and synaptic plasticity (51). But, in malignant gliomas, CSPGs are not associated with HAPLNs and thus may contribute to changes in the matrix scaffold and perineuronal nets affecting ECM solubility and promoting the invasion of gliomas cells to neural tissue (52). A tumor and metastasis protein LGI1 was reduced in GBM samples; this is consistent with significant reduction, inactivation, or absence of LGI1 observed in malignant gliomas, making it a strong tumor suppressor gene candidate involved in the malignant progression (53). The top-most abundant protein for GBM was VWA1, which was about 100-fold higher for PRO and CLA subtype versus controls. No significant difference in VWA1 was observed for IDH1 mutant versus WT samples. Interestingly, plasma von Willebrand factor has been reported to increase in GBM versus controls and suggested as a circulating biomarker of disease malignancy (53).\n      Intriguingly, a majority of matrisomal proteins were increased for GBM compared to control samples, including various collagens, laminins, fibronectin, tenascins, fibrinogens, and various PGs, including CSPG4, AGRN, BGN, glypican 1, and PRELP. CSPG4 has been suggested as a biomarker for GBM that facilitates tumorigenesis and tumor progression (20, 54). Multiple HSPGs and CSPGs core proteins and related enzymes were upregulated in GBM tumors relative to normal brain, including various genes previously implicated in tumor invasion and tumorigenesis and observed by the present study, including glypican 1, CSPG4, BGN, and AGRN (10). In contrast, PRELP was observed to be reduced in other cancers (55, 56). The collagens, laminins, and fibronectin constitute fibrous proteins in the brain matrisome (56). The increase in these fibrous proteins may increase the fibrous network in the brain, thus promoting GBM cell adhesion, invasion, and migration (57). Additionally, these proteins influence the behavior of glioma cells and have been detected within the basal lamina of tumor blood vessels (58). These results clearly indicate the involvement of the ECM in the aggressive and malignant nature of GBM (58).\n      We also showed that the degree or percentage of collagen peptide HPRO was also different between GBM and control tissue, the latter having lower HPRO peptide residues than GBM. Collagen biogenesis requires collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H) activity to catalyze collagen proline hydroxylation. Increased mRNA levels of P4HA1 and P4HA2 have been observed in human breast cancer facilitating collagen deposition and further promoting invasion and metastasis (59). Additional work will be required to understand the effect of the increased collagen HPRO in GBM.\n      Several blood coagulation-related proteins were increased for GBM versus control samples, including VWA1, ANT3, F13A1, FIBA, FIBB, and FIBG. Interestingly, malignant diseases such as cancer have been associated with hypercoagulation, and several coagulation markers have been associated with brain tumor growth, progression, and metastasis, indicating an association of tumor and thromboembolic risk (60).\n      We further investigated the altered matrisome proteins in the IDH1 mutant versus WT status of the samples. Thirty proteins were decreased for IDH1 mutant compared to WT, including CSPG4 and AGRN as the least abundant proteins. Conversely, CSPG4 has been previously reported to increase for both EGFR and PDGFRA amplified tumors (10). Additionally, CSPG4 (also known as NG2) has been reported previously to be frequently expressed in both IDH-mutant and WT GBM, but not lower grade astrocytomas pointing toward its prognostic and therapeutic relevance as a tumor-associated antigen for antibody-based immunotherapy (61).\n      Aberrant glycosylation is strongly associated with cancer progression and plays fundamental roles in numerous steps of cancer development, such as interfering with the cell\u2013cell adhesion, cell\u2013ECM interaction, stimulating the RTK signaling pathway, and promoting angiogenesis (53). Elevated expression of lecticans, namely VCAN (CSPG2), NCAN, and BCAN, have been reported in GBM (46). While we did not see any significant elevation at the protein level, we observed several significantly altered O-glycopeptides, including several peptides for VCAN elevated in GBM. In contrast, O-glycopeptides have been reported to reduce for NCAN compared to controls (62, 63). Additionally, overexpression of NCAN protein has been reported in neuroblastoma (62). Importantly, sialylated O-glycopeptide for BCAN at site T590 was higher for both GBM (no CLA) and PRO subtype versus control samples, while sialylated O-glycopeptide at S625 was increased for GBM versus control samples. Notably, sialylated glycans have been recently reported to be elevated in canine glioma (64). An increase in BCAN in GBM has been linked to increased invasiveness, and sialylation in cancer is related to adhesion and invasion mechanisms increasing metastatic potential of cancer cells (65, 66). These reports, together with our findings, suggest the involvement of glycosylation in GBM tumorigenesis.\n      Moreover, a peptide and two O-glycopeptides in the GAG (alpha) binding region for VCAN were elevated for MES versus PRO subtype, while O-glycopeptide for AGRN and N-glycopeptide for fibrinogen was increased for PRO and CLA subtype versus MES, indicating differential N-and O-glycosylation at subtype level. Interestingly, N-glycopeptide for neuronal cell adhesion molecule, a neural adhesion protein, was decreased for GBM compared to controls. Historically, it has been observed that altered glycosylation mediates a decrease in cancer cell adhesion and increases ECM interaction that may contribute to the invasive and metastatic potential of cancer cells (67, 68). Additionally, a sialylated N-glycopeptide (N129) for fibrinogen gamma showed a 10-fold higher intensity for MES than the CLA subtype. Notably, both fibrinogen and sialylation have been indicated to be involved in cancer metastasis (69, 70), pointing toward a probability of higher invasive potential of MES compared to the CLA subtype.\n      To correlate the glycoproteomics findings, we scrutinized the proteomics data to investigate glycosyltransferase and glycosidase enzyme expression in GBM versus control samples. Intriguingly, we observed an increase in both glycosyltransferase and glycosidase enzymes in GBM versus controls, specifically, dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycosyltransferase various subunit (STT3A, STT3B, 1, 2, 48\u00a0kDa). These are catalytic subunits of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex that catalyzes the first step in protein N-glycosylation that is the initial transfer of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 from the dolichol-PP lipid precursor to an asparagine residue on a peptide in a consensus sequon Asn-X-Ser/Thr (71). Thus, indicating an increase in N-glycosylation for GBM versus control. In addition, various mannosidase and glucosidase that cleaves mannose and glucose residues from Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide precursors catalyzing the processing and maturation of high mannose type N-glycans to more complex type N-glycans (71) were also elevated for GBM versus control, indicating increased N-glycan processing in GBM. A high expression of highly matured multiantennary fucosylated and sialylated N-glycans has been observed in high-grade glioma cells associated with malignant cell behaviors (72).\n      The similarity analysis of glycopeptide also clearly indicated reliable differentiable glycosylation patterns between GBM versus control, PRO versus control, MES versus control, and PRO versus MES comparisons. However, the analysis revealed some heterogeneity in the glycoproteomics data of the CLA subtype, which could be attributed to missing values or a high degree of internal variance. Alternatively, CLA might be too broadly defined as a subtype or its subtype phenotype may be characterized by highly unregulated glycosylation. The present glycoproteomics analysis was performed without any enrichment; thus, in the future, a comprehensive glycoproteomics analysis with enrichment techniques should be employed for a better understanding of the role of ECM glycosylation in GBM.\n      We also performed GSEA and NTA analysis on the differentially regulated matrisome proteins and observed sulfur (GAG) compound binding as the most enriched molecular function for the GBM samples, again emphasizing the importance of GAG, its sulfation pattern, and binding to matrisome molecules in GBM. Moreover, we performed network topology analysis on our data using TCGA RNAseq GBM data and found common genes between the two studies belonging to various crucial networks, including matrisome organization, cell adhesion, and tumor development, all of which have been reported to be enriched in GBM (22, 73) and that promote matrisome-mediated glioma invasion, metastasis, and tumorigenesis.\n      In summary, this study confirmed not only previous data and findings but also produced novel findings for a better understanding of GBM pathogenesis. Fig.5 summarizes changes in the key matrisome component in GBM as observed by this study congruent with literature. However, these findings were based on relatively small sample sets, particularly for controls that were from a single patient and did not have independence from one another; thus, these findings need to be verified with larger cohorts as the next step. In addition, glycoproteins could be enriched to achieve better glycopeptide coverage. Finally, this study identified alterations in key matrisomal molecules, the knowledge of which will enable the exploitation of novel markers and therapeutic targets for GBM and inform the role of glycosylation and ECM in GBM.Fig.\u00a05A summary of key matrisome component changes in GBM as observed by this study (red asterisk \u2217) congruent with the literature (number indicate the references to the literature).\nData Availability\n      The mass spectral data files have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE partner repository (74, 75) with the dataset identifier PXD028931.
