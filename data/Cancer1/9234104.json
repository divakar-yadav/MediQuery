    "abstract": "Brain metastasis (BrM) is one of the major causes of death in cancer patients and is associated \nwith an estimated 10\u201340% of total cancer cases. The survival rate of brain metastatic patients has \nnot improved due to intratumor heterogeneity, the survival adaptations of brain homing metastatic \ncells, and the lack of understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms that limit the availability \nof effective therapies. The heterogeneous population of immune cells and tumor-initiating cells \nor cancer stem cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) release various factors, such as \nchemokines that upon binding to their cognate receptors enhance tumor growth at primary sites \nand help tumor cells metastasize to the brain. Furthermore, brain metastatic sites have unique \nheterogeneous microenvironment that fuels cancer cells in establishing BrM. This review explores \nthe crosstalk of chemokines with the heterogeneous TME during the progression of BrM and \n*To whom all correspondence should be addressed; Mohd Wasim Nasser, Ph.D., Department of Biochemistry and Molecular \nBiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE-68198, USA., wasim.nasser@unmc.edu, Phone: +1-402-5592027.\nAuthor contributions\nSKM and MWN conceived the idea and researched the data for the article and wrote the manuscript.
