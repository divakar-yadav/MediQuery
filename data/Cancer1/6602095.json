    "abstract": "Metastasis, involving the spread of systemic cancer to the brain, results in neurologic disability \nand death. Current treatments are largely palliative in nature; improved therapeutic approaches \nrepresent an unmet clinical need. However, recent experimental and clinical advances challenge \nthe bleak longterm outcome of this disease. Encompassing key recent findings in epidemiology, \ngenetics, microenvironment, leptomeningeal disease, neurocognition, targeted therapy, \nimmunotherapy, and prophylaxis, we review preclinical and clinical studies to provide a \ncomprehensive picture of contemporary research and the management of secondary brain tumors.\n*correspondence: mvaliente@cnio.es (M.
