    "title": "The microenvironmental landscape of brain tumors",
    "abstract": "The brain tumor microenvironment (TME) is emerging as a critical regulator of cancer progression \nin primary and metastatic brain malignancies. The unique properties of this organ require a \nspecific framework for designing TME-targeted interventions. Here we discuss a number of these \ndistinct features, including brain-resident cell types, the blood-brain barrier, and various aspects of \nthe immune-suppressive environment. We also highlight recent advances in therapeutically \ntargeting the brain TME in cancer. By developing a comprehensive understanding of the complex \nand interconnected microenvironmental landscape of brain malignancies we will greatly expand \nthe range of therapeutic strategies available to target these deadly diseases.",
