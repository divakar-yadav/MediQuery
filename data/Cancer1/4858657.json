    "description": "Results\n      \n        Brain cancer chip design and preparation\n        In this study, a brain cancer chip was developed, consisting of four reservoirs (three inlets and one outlet), top cover glass, PEGDA hydrogel layer, and bottom cover glass (Fig. 1a,b). Using a photo-polymerizable PEGDA hydrogel, this brain cancer chip was built by a simple one-step UV lithography process, as detailed in the \u201cMethods\u201d section. A laser-printed plastic film with designed microfluidic patterns was used for the photomask, which required a very low UV density. This technique is more cost-effective than PDMS microfluidic devices, which use more expensive, chrome photomasks. After a few seconds of UV exposure, the microfluidic structures were precisely duplicated in the PEGDA hydrogel layer from the photomask (Fig. 1a). The thickness of the PEGDA hydrogel layer was determined by the height of the spacers on the bottom cover glass, which can be adjusted from micrometer scale to millimeter scale.\n        Figure 1d shows the fabricated brain cancer chip with a hydrogel microfluidic dimension of 2.7\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009cm. The PEGDA hydrogel had a Christmas tree-shaped channel system (gradient generator), an array of 24 individual culture chambers (A1-3, B1-3, C1-3, ect.), and four reservoirs, including three inlets and one outlet (Fig. 1e). The width of the Christmas tree-shaped channels decreased gradually from 300\u2009\u03bcm to 100\u2009\u03bcm. In summary, the culture array had 24 culture chambers, comprised of the main channel, a sub-channel and a microwell (Fig. 1e). The sub-channels, which linked the microwells to the main channel, prevented captured cells from escaping the microwell. Based on the optimization from our previous work26, the constructed microwells had a diameter of 600\u2009\u03bcm and the main channels and sub-channels had a width of 100\u2009\u03bcm.\n      \n      \n        Characterization of the chip\n        The depths of the PEGDA hydrogel microwells and channels were affected by the UV exposure time. Insufficient exposure time was found to fail to cross-link the PEGDA hydrogel, while extended exposure time resulted in over-cross-linking, which changed the dimensions of the microwells and channels. Thus, the UV exposure time was optimized for a hydrogel layer of different thicknesses by measuring the difference between the channel in the photomask and the hydrogel (Fig. 2a). For hydrogel thicknesses of 300\u2009\u03bcm, 400\u2009\u03bcm, 500\u2009\u03bcm, 600\u2009\u03bcm, 700\u2009\u03bcm, and 800\u2009\u03bcm, the optimal UV exposure times were 22.5, 25, 27.5, 29.5, 31.5 and 33.5\u2009seconds, respectively. Thicker hydrogels required longer exposure times, but at decreased rates of change in UV exposure time between hydrogel thicknesses. For example, the 900\u2009\u03bcm-thick hydrogel required 35\u2009seconds to cross-link the PEGDA network, which is 1.5\u2009seconds longer than required for the 800\u2009\u03bcm-thick layer. As mentioned above, a photomask with 600\u2009\u03bcm-diameter microwells and 100\u2009\u03bcm-wide main channels and sub-channels was used. For a microwell thickness of 600\u2009\u03bcm, a UV exposure time of 29.5\u2009seconds at 100\u2009mW/cm2 was optimal. The resulting hydrogel had 600\u2009\u03bcm-diameter microwells, 100\u2009\u03bcm-wide main channels and sub-channels, and 600\u2009\u03bcm-deep and 200\u2009\u03bcm-deep main channels and sub-channels, respectively.\n        To further quantify the spatial resolution of PEGDA hydrogel, photomasks were designed with 20, 50, 100, 200, and 300\u2009\u03bcm-wide channels (Fig. 2b). After cross-linking, the channel widths of the PEGDA hydrogel were measured and it was found that the channels were 19.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.27, 52.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.39, 97.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.59, 196.8\u2009\u00b1\u20094.16, and 303.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.76\u2009\u03bcm-wide, respectively (Fig. 2c). The difference between channel widths of the PEGDA hydrogel and the photomask was 3.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.50%, and the maximum achievable resolution level in our approach was the 20-\u03bcm-wide channel.\n        After the chip was fabricated, its flow capabilities and leakage were assessed through exposure to dyes. Two dyes, red (Eosin) and blue (Chicago blue), were concurrently inserted into two inlets and a mixture of colors was observed to distribute through the parallel channels (Fig. 2d), indicating that no leakage or blockage occurred in the chip. It was observed that the dyes in the middle channels were mixed to the highest degree and the dyes in the outer channels were the most pure in color (red in the left and blue in the right), indicating that the Eosin concentration decreased from the left to the right channel. To further quantify the generated gradient, two 200-\u03bcl solutions of 10-\u03bcM fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were simultaneously pipetted into the left and right inlets, respectively (Fig. 2e). FITC\u2019s fluorescent intensities in the channels were measured and compared to the original solution in the inlet. The fluorescent intensity of FITC was strongest in the left channel (channel A - approximately 80%), further confirming that the solution mixture in this channel came mostly from the left inlet and the FITC concentration decreased gradually from channel A to channel H. The experimental data is similar to the computational calculation (see Supplementary Fig. S1).\n      \n      \n        Measurement of the diffusion in the hydrogel chip\n        PEGDA hydrogel is permeable to various substances (e.g., water, biomolecules, and chemicals) and can controllably facilitate a smart release of chemicals on this chip. Chemicals, such as drugs, can be concentrated and entrapped within the hydrogel and released through diffusion over a prolonged period. To quantify the diffusion characteristics of the PEGDA hydrogel, two dyes were tested with different mass transport properties. First, the fluorescent intensity of FITC (MW\u2009=\u2009150,000\u2009Da) was used to measure the diffusion efficiency of the platform (Fig. 3a). Initially, the distribution of fluorescent dye in the channel was measured after diffusing 200\u2009\u03bcl of 10-\u03bcM FITC solution from the center inlet. It was observed that FITC began to diffuse into the hydrogel after filling the channel, and reached equilibrium after 10\u2009minutes. A similar experiment was performed with low molecular weight 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, MW\u2009=\u2009277\u2009Da) to confirm the diffusional transport of low molecular weight solutes (Fig. 3b). When the distance between channels was 1\u2009mm, the normalized intensity of both DAPI and FITC decreased to less than 4.2%.\n        Notably, this diffusion was driven by concentration gradient. To visualize this process, 10\u2009\u03bcM FITC were loaded into the hydrogel microfluidic chip (see Supplementary Video 1). FITC was observed to diffuse into the hydrogel around the microwell, as shown in Fig. 3c(i), and reach equilibrium after 10\u2009minutes. Then, 1\u2009ml of PBS was loaded into the microfluidic inlet to thoroughly wash non-absorbed FITC from the microwell (see Supplementary Video 2). Figure 3c(ii) shows that, after washing, the fluorescent intensity of FITC increased inside the microwell and reduced in the hydrogel around the microwell. Figure 3d graphically represents the change in fluorescent intensity in the microwell after injecting FITC (Fig. 3c(i)) and after washing with PBS (Fig. 3c(ii)). After the FITC injection, the fluorescent intensity in the microwell increased to 85%. After washing with PBS, the fluorescent intensity of the microwell wall decreased to approximately 45% and the fluorescent intensity of the microwell cavity decreased to almost 0%. Ten minutes after washing, the fluorescent intensity of the microwell cavity increased to 50% (Fig. 3d), quantitatively suggesting that FITC diffused from the hydrogel walls back into the cavity of the microwell.\n      \n      \n        GBM cell capture, culture and 3D spheroid formation\n        Cell capture is critical to platform efficiency, where microfluidic geometry significantly affects the cell capture efficiency. Six different microfluidic structures were designed and tested in our experiments (see Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Video 3) and the current culture chamber structure was chosen. To find an appropriate cell seeding concentration, a series of cell concentrations was assessed by using GBM cells (U87) at the following concentrations: 0.01\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml, 0.05\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml, 0.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml, 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml and 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml, shown in Fig. 4a. Initially, cell concentrations of 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml and 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml were used. It was observed that the microwells were over-filled with cells under both cell concentrations in one week (Fig. 4a(iv,v)). The concentration of 0.01\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml, which equals a cell density of only 42\u2009cells/mm2 (around 12 cells per microwell), was too low to promote the quick formation of cell spheroids in one week (Fig. 4a(i)). For cell concentrations of 0.05\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml and 0.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml, approximately 43 and 141 cells per microwell were captured, respectively (Fig. 4a(ii,iii)). An optimal cell seeding concentration of 0.05\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml was chosen.\n        The captured GBM cells were then cultured in the PEGDA hydrogel microfluidic chip and their development into 3D GBM spheroids in the microwells was observed (Fig. 4b). The captured GBM cells did not adhere to the channel surface because of PEGDA hydrogel\u2019s cell-repellant properties, and they started to aggregate in the microwells after 1\u20132 days. The cells proliferated within the PEGDA microwells during the following culture and formed cancer spheroids with a diameter of 300\u2013400\u2009\u03bcm that were used after 7 days for drug testing. Because PEGDA hydrogel is biocompatible, GBM spheroids were highly viable on day 7, as shown by live/dead staining (Fig. 4c). On day 7, 24 GBM spheroids had formed in the PEGDA microwells (Fig. 4d(i)), with a uniform size (361.3\u2009\u00b1\u200936.2\u2009\u03bcm in diameter) (Fig. 4d(ii)). The layered structure of the 3D GBM spheroid resulted in a hypoxic center similar to the in vivo environment of a GBM tumor mass, most common during the early stage of tumor development.\n      \n      \n        Drug screening\n        To demonstrate the effectiveness of two widely used anti-cancer drugs on GBM spheroids by the chip, two FDA approved drugs were used: Pitavastatin (trade name Livalo) and Irinotecan. Pitavastatin is a member of the statin class of drugs that inhibits the growth of several cancer cell types by suppressing inflammation, inducing apoptosis, and modulating angiogenesis27. Irinotecan is a topoisomerase I enzyme inhibitor that blocks topoisomerase I to prevent cells from dividing and growing28. These two anticancer drugs, Pitavastatin (10\u2009\u03bcM, 100\u2009\u03bcl)29 and Irinotecan (100\u2009\u03bcM, 100\u2009\u03bcl)30 were concurrently administered into the hydrogel microfluidic device via the two inlets (Fig. 5a). Figure 5b shows the effect of dual-drug administration on the cancer spheroids over time as they collapsed. The edges of the cancer spheroids were crisp and the spheroids continued to grow prior to adding the drugs. However, the structure of the cancer spheroids became loose and cells were clearly observed to detach from the spheroids, as well as undergo autophagic cell death after the drugs were added.\n        To assess the efficacy of different drug combinations, trypan blue dye was loaded into middle inlet of the chip to indicate cell viability. Semi-quantitative evaluation of the combinatorial drug effect for each channel was performed through observation with the naked eye. Figure 5c shows an image of the trypan blue staining for each channel. Channel D showed the most trypan blue staining, providing a quick and semi-quantitative conclusion that the concentrations of Pitavastatin and Irinotecan in channel D were superior to the concentrations in the other channels. The quantitative results of cell viability are shown in Fig. 5d (See \u201cMethods\u201d for more details). On day 1 of dual-drug administration, the cell viability in channel A was around 70%, while the cell viability in channel H was 71%. At that time, channel D had the lowest cell viability of approximately 55%. The cell viabilities reduced to 50% in all channels after 4 days of dual-drug administration. For channel D, the cell viability was 39.67%. The combinatorial drug treatment in channel D was also compared with the individual drug screening of Pitavastatin (10\u2009\u03bcM, 100\u2009\u03bcl) and Irinotecan (100\u2009\u03bcM, 100\u2009\u03bcl), as well as the untreated GBM spheroid cells on day 1, 4 and 7, as shown in Fig. 5e. In the untreated GBM cells, the cell viabilities were 95% on day 4 and 90% on day 7. The treatment with Pitavastatin reduced the cell viabilities to 90% on day 1, 85% on day 4 and 75% on day 7. However, the treatment with Irinotecan reduced the cell viabilities to 70% on day 1, 50% on day 4 and 40% on day 7.\n        In addition to the determination of approximate concentration of Pitavastatin and Irinotecan at each point using the COMSOL model (www.comsol.com), and the effect of combinatorial drug on the spheroid cell viability in our platform, we also used the Chou-Talalay (CT) predictive model (www.combosyn.com) to study the synergy and antagonism between these two drugs31. The experimental data, including the drug concentration and cell viability information, were entered into the CT model to predict the viability information related to the effect of combinatorial drugs on the GBM spheroid cells. Supplementary Fig. S2 shows the dose effect curve for each drug individually and their combination. The CT model also suggested that the drug combination is much more effective than individual drugs on the cell viability of the GBM cancer spheroids. Furthermore, these findings confirm the reliability of the data obtained in this study and the efficacy of using combinatorial drugs for the treatment of cancer cells.\n      \n      \n        Tunable release of drugs\n        The chip was assessed for tunable drug-release capabilities. Diffusion was observed when the drugs were applied to the GBM spheroids in the brain cancer chip. As discussed previously, we cultured 3D GBM spheroids in the hydrogel microfluidic chip and took time-lapse images of cancer spheroids in the microwells to observe the effectiveness of Pitavastatin and Irinotecan. A single administration of Pitavastatin (10\u2009\u03bcM, 100\u2009\u03bcl) and Irinotecan (100\u2009\u03bcM, 100\u2009\u03bcl) was applied to the two inlets on day 7 of cell culture (Fig. 6a). On days 8, 10, and 12, the media was replaced with fresh, drug-free culture media (Fig. 6a). Despite a single application of drugs and frequent media changes, consistent cell death in the microwells was observed over the course of the experiment (Fig. 6b). This consistent drug effect came from the drugs\u2019 release from the hydrogel of the microwell, which was in accordance with the phenomenon seen in the FITC experiment (Fig. 3c,d). After 10\u2009minutes, the drugs were estimated to diffuse back into the microwell. The drug concentration in the microwell stabilized once the diffused drugs reached equilibrium. Uptake of the drugs by cells in the cancer spheroids reduced the drug concentration in the microwell. Concurrently, the drug concentration reduction was counterbalanced by the equilibrium-driven drug diffusion from the hydrogel back into the microwell. This resulted in continual drug release after a single dose.\nBrain cancer chip design and preparation\n        In this study, a brain cancer chip was developed, consisting of four reservoirs (three inlets and one outlet), top cover glass, PEGDA hydrogel layer, and bottom cover glass (Fig. 1a,b). Using a photo-polymerizable PEGDA hydrogel, this brain cancer chip was built by a simple one-step UV lithography process, as detailed in the \u201cMethods\u201d section. A laser-printed plastic film with designed microfluidic patterns was used for the photomask, which required a very low UV density. This technique is more cost-effective than PDMS microfluidic devices, which use more expensive, chrome photomasks. After a few seconds of UV exposure, the microfluidic structures were precisely duplicated in the PEGDA hydrogel layer from the photomask (Fig. 1a). The thickness of the PEGDA hydrogel layer was determined by the height of the spacers on the bottom cover glass, which can be adjusted from micrometer scale to millimeter scale.\n        Figure 1d shows the fabricated brain cancer chip with a hydrogel microfluidic dimension of 2.7\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009cm. The PEGDA hydrogel had a Christmas tree-shaped channel system (gradient generator), an array of 24 individual culture chambers (A1-3, B1-3, C1-3, ect.), and four reservoirs, including three inlets and one outlet (Fig. 1e). The width of the Christmas tree-shaped channels decreased gradually from 300\u2009\u03bcm to 100\u2009\u03bcm. In summary, the culture array had 24 culture chambers, comprised of the main channel, a sub-channel and a microwell (Fig. 1e). The sub-channels, which linked the microwells to the main channel, prevented captured cells from escaping the microwell. Based on the optimization from our previous work26, the constructed microwells had a diameter of 600\u2009\u03bcm and the main channels and sub-channels had a width of 100\u2009\u03bcm.\nCharacterization of the chip\n        The depths of the PEGDA hydrogel microwells and channels were affected by the UV exposure time. Insufficient exposure time was found to fail to cross-link the PEGDA hydrogel, while extended exposure time resulted in over-cross-linking, which changed the dimensions of the microwells and channels. Thus, the UV exposure time was optimized for a hydrogel layer of different thicknesses by measuring the difference between the channel in the photomask and the hydrogel (Fig. 2a). For hydrogel thicknesses of 300\u2009\u03bcm, 400\u2009\u03bcm, 500\u2009\u03bcm, 600\u2009\u03bcm, 700\u2009\u03bcm, and 800\u2009\u03bcm, the optimal UV exposure times were 22.5, 25, 27.5, 29.5, 31.5 and 33.5\u2009seconds, respectively. Thicker hydrogels required longer exposure times, but at decreased rates of change in UV exposure time between hydrogel thicknesses. For example, the 900\u2009\u03bcm-thick hydrogel required 35\u2009seconds to cross-link the PEGDA network, which is 1.5\u2009seconds longer than required for the 800\u2009\u03bcm-thick layer. As mentioned above, a photomask with 600\u2009\u03bcm-diameter microwells and 100\u2009\u03bcm-wide main channels and sub-channels was used. For a microwell thickness of 600\u2009\u03bcm, a UV exposure time of 29.5\u2009seconds at 100\u2009mW/cm2 was optimal. The resulting hydrogel had 600\u2009\u03bcm-diameter microwells, 100\u2009\u03bcm-wide main channels and sub-channels, and 600\u2009\u03bcm-deep and 200\u2009\u03bcm-deep main channels and sub-channels, respectively.\n        To further quantify the spatial resolution of PEGDA hydrogel, photomasks were designed with 20, 50, 100, 200, and 300\u2009\u03bcm-wide channels (Fig. 2b). After cross-linking, the channel widths of the PEGDA hydrogel were measured and it was found that the channels were 19.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.27, 52.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.39, 97.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.59, 196.8\u2009\u00b1\u20094.16, and 303.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.76\u2009\u03bcm-wide, respectively (Fig. 2c). The difference between channel widths of the PEGDA hydrogel and the photomask was 3.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.50%, and the maximum achievable resolution level in our approach was the 20-\u03bcm-wide channel.\n        After the chip was fabricated, its flow capabilities and leakage were assessed through exposure to dyes. Two dyes, red (Eosin) and blue (Chicago blue), were concurrently inserted into two inlets and a mixture of colors was observed to distribute through the parallel channels (Fig. 2d), indicating that no leakage or blockage occurred in the chip. It was observed that the dyes in the middle channels were mixed to the highest degree and the dyes in the outer channels were the most pure in color (red in the left and blue in the right), indicating that the Eosin concentration decreased from the left to the right channel. To further quantify the generated gradient, two 200-\u03bcl solutions of 10-\u03bcM fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were simultaneously pipetted into the left and right inlets, respectively (Fig. 2e). FITC\u2019s fluorescent intensities in the channels were measured and compared to the original solution in the inlet. The fluorescent intensity of FITC was strongest in the left channel (channel A - approximately 80%), further confirming that the solution mixture in this channel came mostly from the left inlet and the FITC concentration decreased gradually from channel A to channel H. The experimental data is similar to the computational calculation (see Supplementary Fig. S1).\nMeasurement of the diffusion in the hydrogel chip\n        PEGDA hydrogel is permeable to various substances (e.g., water, biomolecules, and chemicals) and can controllably facilitate a smart release of chemicals on this chip. Chemicals, such as drugs, can be concentrated and entrapped within the hydrogel and released through diffusion over a prolonged period. To quantify the diffusion characteristics of the PEGDA hydrogel, two dyes were tested with different mass transport properties. First, the fluorescent intensity of FITC (MW\u2009=\u2009150,000\u2009Da) was used to measure the diffusion efficiency of the platform (Fig. 3a). Initially, the distribution of fluorescent dye in the channel was measured after diffusing 200\u2009\u03bcl of 10-\u03bcM FITC solution from the center inlet. It was observed that FITC began to diffuse into the hydrogel after filling the channel, and reached equilibrium after 10\u2009minutes. A similar experiment was performed with low molecular weight 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, MW\u2009=\u2009277\u2009Da) to confirm the diffusional transport of low molecular weight solutes (Fig. 3b). When the distance between channels was 1\u2009mm, the normalized intensity of both DAPI and FITC decreased to less than 4.2%.\n        Notably, this diffusion was driven by concentration gradient. To visualize this process, 10\u2009\u03bcM FITC were loaded into the hydrogel microfluidic chip (see Supplementary Video 1). FITC was observed to diffuse into the hydrogel around the microwell, as shown in Fig. 3c(i), and reach equilibrium after 10\u2009minutes. Then, 1\u2009ml of PBS was loaded into the microfluidic inlet to thoroughly wash non-absorbed FITC from the microwell (see Supplementary Video 2). Figure 3c(ii) shows that, after washing, the fluorescent intensity of FITC increased inside the microwell and reduced in the hydrogel around the microwell. Figure 3d graphically represents the change in fluorescent intensity in the microwell after injecting FITC (Fig. 3c(i)) and after washing with PBS (Fig. 3c(ii)). After the FITC injection, the fluorescent intensity in the microwell increased to 85%. After washing with PBS, the fluorescent intensity of the microwell wall decreased to approximately 45% and the fluorescent intensity of the microwell cavity decreased to almost 0%. Ten minutes after washing, the fluorescent intensity of the microwell cavity increased to 50% (Fig. 3d), quantitatively suggesting that FITC diffused from the hydrogel walls back into the cavity of the microwell.\nGBM cell capture, culture and 3D spheroid formation\n        Cell capture is critical to platform efficiency, where microfluidic geometry significantly affects the cell capture efficiency. Six different microfluidic structures were designed and tested in our experiments (see Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Video 3) and the current culture chamber structure was chosen. To find an appropriate cell seeding concentration, a series of cell concentrations was assessed by using GBM cells (U87) at the following concentrations: 0.01\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml, 0.05\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml, 0.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml, 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml and 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml, shown in Fig. 4a. Initially, cell concentrations of 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml and 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml were used. It was observed that the microwells were over-filled with cells under both cell concentrations in one week (Fig. 4a(iv,v)). The concentration of 0.01\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml, which equals a cell density of only 42\u2009cells/mm2 (around 12 cells per microwell), was too low to promote the quick formation of cell spheroids in one week (Fig. 4a(i)). For cell concentrations of 0.05\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml and 0.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml, approximately 43 and 141 cells per microwell were captured, respectively (Fig. 4a(ii,iii)). An optimal cell seeding concentration of 0.05\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml was chosen.\n        The captured GBM cells were then cultured in the PEGDA hydrogel microfluidic chip and their development into 3D GBM spheroids in the microwells was observed (Fig. 4b). The captured GBM cells did not adhere to the channel surface because of PEGDA hydrogel\u2019s cell-repellant properties, and they started to aggregate in the microwells after 1\u20132 days. The cells proliferated within the PEGDA microwells during the following culture and formed cancer spheroids with a diameter of 300\u2013400\u2009\u03bcm that were used after 7 days for drug testing. Because PEGDA hydrogel is biocompatible, GBM spheroids were highly viable on day 7, as shown by live/dead staining (Fig. 4c). On day 7, 24 GBM spheroids had formed in the PEGDA microwells (Fig. 4d(i)), with a uniform size (361.3\u2009\u00b1\u200936.2\u2009\u03bcm in diameter) (Fig. 4d(ii)). The layered structure of the 3D GBM spheroid resulted in a hypoxic center similar to the in vivo environment of a GBM tumor mass, most common during the early stage of tumor development.\nDrug screening\n        To demonstrate the effectiveness of two widely used anti-cancer drugs on GBM spheroids by the chip, two FDA approved drugs were used: Pitavastatin (trade name Livalo) and Irinotecan. Pitavastatin is a member of the statin class of drugs that inhibits the growth of several cancer cell types by suppressing inflammation, inducing apoptosis, and modulating angiogenesis27. Irinotecan is a topoisomerase I enzyme inhibitor that blocks topoisomerase I to prevent cells from dividing and growing28. These two anticancer drugs, Pitavastatin (10\u2009\u03bcM, 100\u2009\u03bcl)29 and Irinotecan (100\u2009\u03bcM, 100\u2009\u03bcl)30 were concurrently administered into the hydrogel microfluidic device via the two inlets (Fig. 5a). Figure 5b shows the effect of dual-drug administration on the cancer spheroids over time as they collapsed. The edges of the cancer spheroids were crisp and the spheroids continued to grow prior to adding the drugs. However, the structure of the cancer spheroids became loose and cells were clearly observed to detach from the spheroids, as well as undergo autophagic cell death after the drugs were added.\n        To assess the efficacy of different drug combinations, trypan blue dye was loaded into middle inlet of the chip to indicate cell viability. Semi-quantitative evaluation of the combinatorial drug effect for each channel was performed through observation with the naked eye. Figure 5c shows an image of the trypan blue staining for each channel. Channel D showed the most trypan blue staining, providing a quick and semi-quantitative conclusion that the concentrations of Pitavastatin and Irinotecan in channel D were superior to the concentrations in the other channels. The quantitative results of cell viability are shown in Fig. 5d (See \u201cMethods\u201d for more details). On day 1 of dual-drug administration, the cell viability in channel A was around 70%, while the cell viability in channel H was 71%. At that time, channel D had the lowest cell viability of approximately 55%. The cell viabilities reduced to 50% in all channels after 4 days of dual-drug administration. For channel D, the cell viability was 39.67%. The combinatorial drug treatment in channel D was also compared with the individual drug screening of Pitavastatin (10\u2009\u03bcM, 100\u2009\u03bcl) and Irinotecan (100\u2009\u03bcM, 100\u2009\u03bcl), as well as the untreated GBM spheroid cells on day 1, 4 and 7, as shown in Fig. 5e. In the untreated GBM cells, the cell viabilities were 95% on day 4 and 90% on day 7. The treatment with Pitavastatin reduced the cell viabilities to 90% on day 1, 85% on day 4 and 75% on day 7. However, the treatment with Irinotecan reduced the cell viabilities to 70% on day 1, 50% on day 4 and 40% on day 7.\n        In addition to the determination of approximate concentration of Pitavastatin and Irinotecan at each point using the COMSOL model (www.comsol.com), and the effect of combinatorial drug on the spheroid cell viability in our platform, we also used the Chou-Talalay (CT) predictive model (www.combosyn.com) to study the synergy and antagonism between these two drugs31. The experimental data, including the drug concentration and cell viability information, were entered into the CT model to predict the viability information related to the effect of combinatorial drugs on the GBM spheroid cells. Supplementary Fig. S2 shows the dose effect curve for each drug individually and their combination. The CT model also suggested that the drug combination is much more effective than individual drugs on the cell viability of the GBM cancer spheroids. Furthermore, these findings confirm the reliability of the data obtained in this study and the efficacy of using combinatorial drugs for the treatment of cancer cells.\nTunable release of drugs\n        The chip was assessed for tunable drug-release capabilities. Diffusion was observed when the drugs were applied to the GBM spheroids in the brain cancer chip. As discussed previously, we cultured 3D GBM spheroids in the hydrogel microfluidic chip and took time-lapse images of cancer spheroids in the microwells to observe the effectiveness of Pitavastatin and Irinotecan. A single administration of Pitavastatin (10\u2009\u03bcM, 100\u2009\u03bcl) and Irinotecan (100\u2009\u03bcM, 100\u2009\u03bcl) was applied to the two inlets on day 7 of cell culture (Fig. 6a). On days 8, 10, and 12, the media was replaced with fresh, drug-free culture media (Fig. 6a). Despite a single application of drugs and frequent media changes, consistent cell death in the microwells was observed over the course of the experiment (Fig. 6b). This consistent drug effect came from the drugs\u2019 release from the hydrogel of the microwell, which was in accordance with the phenomenon seen in the FITC experiment (Fig. 3c,d). After 10\u2009minutes, the drugs were estimated to diffuse back into the microwell. The drug concentration in the microwell stabilized once the diffused drugs reached equilibrium. Uptake of the drugs by cells in the cancer spheroids reduced the drug concentration in the microwell. Concurrently, the drug concentration reduction was counterbalanced by the equilibrium-driven drug diffusion from the hydrogel back into the microwell. This resulted in continual drug release after a single dose.\nDiscussion\n      In this study, we developed a simple, flexible and cost-effective hydrogel microfluidic device (i.e., brain cancer chip) for high-throughput drug screening based on 3D GBM spheroid culture. Our hydrogel microfluidic device was tested as a screening platform for drug testing of GBM. The results indicate that this brain cancer chip features high-throughput GBM cancer-spheroid formation by providing a large amount of micro-sized culture chambers, multiple-simultaneous drug administration (that can be economically modified and flexibly constructed by re-designing the microfluidic patterns), and massive-parallel testing of drug response under a biocompatible 3D microenvironment. This chip perfectly fills the gap for a much-needed screening tool to personalize medicines. As an in vitro 3D cell culture model, this chip could help reduce the time and cost to perform preclinical studies. The proposed novel platform could be useful and cost-effective for high-throughput screening of cancer drugs and assessment of treatment responses in personalized medicine.\n      In comparison to the normal fabrication of PDMS microfluidic devices that usually takes two days, the fabrication of our PEGDA hydrogel microfluidic chip takes less than two hours, which is more time-efficient (Fig. 1c). While measuring the diffusion in the hydrogel chip, it was noted that at an inter-channel distance of 1\u2009mm, the normalized intensity decreased to less than 4.2%, as seen in Fig. 3b. This result suggests that cross talk between channels in the chip could be eliminated by increasing the distance between each channel to over 2\u2009mm. Upon visualization of the diffusion process, the diffusion was observed to be driven by the concentration gradient, which clearly indicates that this diffusion process is tunable.\n      Following dual-drug administration, the cell viability in each of the channels was assessed and channel D was determined to have the lowest level of cell viability of approximately 55% on day 1 of dual-drug administration (Fig. 5d), suggesting that the most effective combinatorial treatment of Pitavastatin and Irinotecan came from channel D, where the concentration of Pitavastatin was 6\u2009\u03bcM and Irinotecan was 40\u2009\u03bcM, according to the previous quantitative characterization (Fig. 2e(iii)). Also, the cell viabilities in all channels decreased to below 50% after 4 days of dual-drug administration, and the cell viability at that time in channel D, containing the optimal combination of Pitavastatin and Irinotecan, was 39.67%. Therefore, it was determined that the brain cancer chip was able to give drug screening results as soon as four days after drug application. In comparing the combinatorial drug treatment in channel D with the individual drug screenings and the untreated GMB spheroid cells, it was found that on day 4, the cell viabilities in the untreated, Pitavastatin treated, and Irinotecan treated spheroids decreased to 95%, 85% and 50%, respectively. Therefore, the combinatorial drug treatment was more effective than those of individual drugs. Furthermore, the cell viability of the untreated GMB spheroids was above 90% on day 7, which confirms the stability of the platform.\n      Our platform, based on PEGDA microfluidic systems, differs from existing microfluidic platforms, which utilize PDMS microfluidics technology. PEGDA is photo-polymerizable and can be solidified after brief exposure to UV light. Since PDMS suffers from small hydrophobic molecule adsorption and PEGDA blocks non-specific protein adsorption11, the use of PEGDA in our approach directed GBM cells to grow into tumor spheroids, creating an in vitro 3D microenvironment and suggesting that our platform better mimics the in vivo 3D microenvironment. While the normal fabrication of PDMS microfluidic devices takes two days, the fabrication of our hydrogel microfluidic platform takes less than two hours. The photo-polymerization procedure in our platform production requires low UV density and thus eliminates the need for an expensive chrome photomask, which is required to produce the PDMS microfluidic platform. The economical plastic photomask allows for quick modification and flexibility in constructing the PEGDA microfluidic patterns. Furthermore, our platform provides a tunable drug release, which cannot be achieved by existing microfluidic drug testing platforms, including PDMS-based platforms. The tunable drug release capability is the most significant advantage of our microfluidic platform.\n      The layered structure of the 3D GBM spheroid resulted in a hypoxic center similar to the in vivo environment of a GBM tumor mass during the early stages of tumor development, indicating that our hydrogel microfluidic device successfully functions as a brain cancer chip.\n      In future application, a tiny tissue sample can be collected from a patient by biopsy and cultured in this brain cancer chip. Various drugs can be applied in massive-parallel form. In a week, quick semi-quantitative results can be observed by judging the color of each channel with the naked eye. This chip can also be directly interfaced with custom software to quantify the outcomes and simplify data collection and analysis for clinicians. These potentials make this brain cancer chip a powerful platform for quick preliminary assessments for the efficacy and success of potential drug(s) prior to individual patient administration for personalized medicine. Also, the cross-linking of PEGDA under UV light can efficiently and inexpensively generate microfluidic devices, allowing for widespread application, and is especially promising in developing countries.\nMethods\n      \n        Fabrication of the hydrogel microfluidic device\n        3-(Trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate 98% (TMSPMA) was used to generate an adhesive surface to PEGDA hydrogels on the cover glass (24\u2009\u00d7\u200960\u2009mm cover glasses purchased from Corning Incorporated). Briefly, glass slides were placed in 10% (w/v) NaOH overnight and then washed with distilled water, ethanol 70%, and ethanol 100% repeatedly. After drying at ambient temperature, glass slides were stacked and wetted by 2\u2009ml of TMSPMA before keeping at 70\u2009\u00b0C overnight. Finally, TMSPMA-coated glass slides were rinsed with ethanol three times, dried, and stored at room temperature. The top cover glass was drilled with four orifices that were three outlets and one inlet of the chip. The microfluidic patterns were designed by using AutoCAD (Autodesk, Inc.) and then printed on transparent plastics (Fig. 1a) as photomasks (purchased from CADart Washington, USA). The PEGDA brain cancer chip was fabricated by using the soft lithography method shown in Fig. 1a. PEGDA monomer (MW\u2009=\u2009750 Daltons, Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) was dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 40% (w/w) with the presence of photoinitiator 2-Hydroxy-4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone (PI). After mixing thoroughly, 1\u2009ml PEGDA monomer solution prepared above was pipetted in between two cover glasses for polymerization (top cover glass contained orifices for inlets and outlet, and the bottom cover glass had two spacers). Photo-polymerization was initiated with an Omnicure S2000 (320\u2013500\u2009nm, EXFO, Ontario, Canada) lamp at 100\u2009mW/cm2 (measured for 365\u2009nm) at a working distance of 16\u2009cm. After UV exposure, the PEGDA monomer solution was cross-linked into solid PEGDA hydrogel and integrated with the two cover glasses to form a chip. This chip was washed in PBS to remove uncross-linked liquid monomers and PI. Then, adhesive rings were sealed onto the orifices as inlet and outlet reservoirs.\n      \n      \n        Optimization of the UV exposure time\n        Brain cancer chips with different thicknesses were prepared by adjusting the height of spacers between two cover glasses. Nine spacers from 200\u2009\u03bcm to 900\u2009\u03bcm in height were used and each chip with designed spacer was exposed under the UV light from 20\u2009seconds to 35\u2009seconds to optimize the suitable experimental conditions. PEGDA hydrogel failed to crosslink with insufficient exposure, while the extended exposure resulted in over-cross-linking that blocked the channels and the microwells. The increase of hydrogel layer thickness required longer UV exposure time.\n      \n      \n        Stability and leaking test of hydrogel microfluidics\n        Chicago blue (0.993\u2009mg, 0.001\u2009mmol, Sigma) was dissolved in PBS to a concentration of 5\u2009\u03bcM. One ml of Chicago blue solution was injected gradually from an inlet to observe flow in the microchannel. Excess liquid at the outlet was removed gently by pipet. Liquid leakage was confirmed by spread of Chicago blue out of the microchannel.\n      \n      \n        Computational modeling\n        The microfluidic platform was modeled by COMSOL Multiphysics (www.comsol.com) to assess the channel composition. A 3D model was implemented to estimate the chemical-input ratio in different channels and their concentrations in the mixtures. For the multi-physics modeling, we used a modeled geometry with the same dimensions as our PEGDA hydrogel platform. FITC solutions at concentrations of 50\u2009\u03bcM and 0\u2009\u03bcM were injected into the left and right inlets, respectively. Assuming creeping flow and a stationary solver, the fluid concentration rates in the microwells along the channels were estimated using the incompressible Stokes equations:\n        \n          \n            \n          \n        \n        where \u03c1 is fluid density, u is the local velocity, p is the pressure (Pa) and \u03bc is the fluid viscosity. Diffusion constant was set to 2.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221210. A no-slip condition was imposed on the capillary walls, with zero pressure at the outlet, while fluid concentration at inlets were set to 10\u22125\u2009\u03bcM and 0\u2009\u03bcM, respectively. Hypothesizing that the flow rates are given and the viscosity is the same everywhere in the hydrogel microfluidics, the concentrations of FITC reduced gradually from the left to the right channels. Channels 1 and 2 were measured at 48\u2009\u03bcM, revealing that the ratio of the mixture between two solutions from left and right inlets was 96:4. In channels 3 and 4, 71% of the chemical in the solution mixture came from the solution injected through the left inlet. This ratio continued to decline to 35:65 in channels 5 and 6 and reached the ratio of 4:96 in channels 7 and 8 (see Supplementary Fig. S1). This shows that the chemical composition in individual channels and microwells can be estimated for drug screening, and applied to predict the combinatorial drug treatment.\n      \n      \n        Characterization of diffusion\n        Eosin (0.65\u2009mg, 0.001\u2009mmol, Sigma) was added to 100\u2009ml of PBS to a final concentration of 10\u2009\u03bcM. Chicago blue 5-\u03bcM and Eosin 10-\u03bcM were injected simultaneously into two outer inlets (Fig. 2d). The color appearances in channels change from distinct red (left) to blue (right). For further investigation of the solution gradients in the channels, two 200-\u03bcl solutions of 10\u2009\u03bcM FITC and PBS were injected concurrently into two outer inlets (Fig. 2e). The fluorescent intensities of FITC in the channels were quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) and are shown in Fig. 2e.\n        A 200-\u03bcl solution of 10-\u03bcM FITC was injected into the center inlet and channels containing fluorescence were observed under an Olympus fluorescence microscope. Time-lapse images were taken at 15\u2009sec, 1\u2009min, 3\u2009min, 5\u2009min, 10\u2009min, 15\u2009min, 20\u2009min and 30\u2009min (Fig. 3a). The fluorescent intensities were quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). A similar experiment was repeated to investigate the diffusion of DAPI (a low molecular weight molecule) in hydrogel platform. To verify the microfluidics platform\u2019s tunable chemical release, 1\u2009ml solution of FITC 10\u2009\u03bcM was injected into a channel (300\u2009\u03bcm width) with a microwell (1000\u2009\u03bcm diameter). Video was taken by time-lapse imaging by an Olympus fluorescence microscope for 1\u2009min. Time-lapse images were taken at different time points (1\u2009min, 3\u2009min, 5\u2009min and 10\u2009min) to quantify the diffusion of FITC to hydrogel from the microwell. Next, 1\u2009ml PBS was inserted to remove all FITC solution in the microwell. Video and time-lapse images were recorded (Fig. 3c). The fluorescent intensities were quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health).\n      \n      \n        Preparation and culture of GBM cells\n        The U87 cells were cultured in cell culture medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 100\u2009U/ml penicillin and 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml streptomycin. All cells were manipulated under sterile tissue culture hoods and maintained in a 95% air \u22125% CO2 humidified incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The U87 cells were plated at a concentration of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml in 10-cm diameter tissue culture dishes and were passaged every 3 days at a subculture ratio of 1:4. After trypsinization and centrifugation, the U87 cells were collected and calculated using a hemacytometer (Hausser Scientific, 1483). To test cell capture efficiency in different designs of microchannels and microwells, the cell suspensions were diluted with the cell medium to prepare exact concentrations (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml) and seeded into the microfluidic device from the center inlet. Cell capture videos were taken by time-lapse imaging using Olympus fluorescence microscope (see Supplementary Video 3). Extra cells in the microchannels were removed by adding 1\u2009ml fresh medium twice. In addition to the microfluidic geometry, the microchannel and microwell dimensions play an important role in achieving high cell capture efficiency.\n        To optimize a proper cell seeding concentration, a series of cell concentrations of U87 cells (0.01\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml, 0.05\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml, 0.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml, 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml and 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml) were injected (100\u2009\u03bcl) into the center inlet. The cells aggregated to form cancer spheroids and were cultured in the microfluidic microwells for 7 days; medium was changed every 24\u2009hours by removing 500\u2009\u03bcl of solution from the outlet, and adding 500\u2009\u03bcl of fresh growth media into the inlets. Time-lapse images were taken by fluorescence microscope to monitor the cancer spheroid growth. The Live/Dead Cell Viability Assay Kit was performed to measure the U87 cell viability in the microfluidic microwells. The kit, containing calcein AM (2\u2009\u03bcg/ml in PBS) and ethidium homodimer (4\u2009\u03bcg/ml in PBS) reagents, was prepared as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The prepared Live/Dead solution was dropped into the center inlet on the hydrogel microfluidics, and was incubated with cells in the microfluidic microwells for 30\u2009minutes and the images were captured. Green fluorescence was measured due to the calcein AM reaction from viable cells and damaged cell membranes were stained red due to their reaction with ethidium homodimer.\n      \n      \n        Combinatorial drug screening\n        Cancer spheroids were formed and cultured for 7 days. On the first day of dual-drug treatment, Pitavastatin (10\u2009\u03bcM, 100\u2009\u03bcl) and Irinotecan (100\u2009\u03bcM, 100\u2009\u03bcl), prepared in Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline (PBS), were injected into the two inlets (Fig. 5a), and the hydrogel microfluidic platforms were cultured and maintained in a 95% air-5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The growth media was exchanged every other day by removing 500\u2009\u03bcl of solution from the outlet, and adding 500\u2009\u03bcl of fresh growth media into the inlets. Time-lapse images were taken from Olympus fluorescence microscope at day 1, day 4 and day 7 of dual-drug treatment to observe the efficiency of the drugs on cancer spheroids (Fig. 5b). Cells from each microwell were harvested and checked for cell viability on days 1, 4, and 7 after drug administration. Each microchannel was cut from the hydrogel platform and the cells were harvested to check cell viability. Cells were washed twice with PBS and mixed with an equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue for 3\u2009minutes. The unstained (viable) and stained (lysed) cells were counted using a hemacytometer.\n      \n      \n        Typan blue staining and quantitative characterization\n        Trypan blue staining was used to check cell viabilities on day 4 after drug administration in the brain cancer chip. Cells were washed twice with 200\u2009\u03bcl PBS injected from inlets. Next, 200\u2009\u03bcl of 0.4% trypan blue was added and the chip was incubated for 3\u2009minutes. The unstained (viable) and stained (lysed) cells were observed under Olympus fluorescence microscope.\nFabrication of the hydrogel microfluidic device\n        3-(Trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate 98% (TMSPMA) was used to generate an adhesive surface to PEGDA hydrogels on the cover glass (24\u2009\u00d7\u200960\u2009mm cover glasses purchased from Corning Incorporated). Briefly, glass slides were placed in 10% (w/v) NaOH overnight and then washed with distilled water, ethanol 70%, and ethanol 100% repeatedly. After drying at ambient temperature, glass slides were stacked and wetted by 2\u2009ml of TMSPMA before keeping at 70\u2009\u00b0C overnight. Finally, TMSPMA-coated glass slides were rinsed with ethanol three times, dried, and stored at room temperature. The top cover glass was drilled with four orifices that were three outlets and one inlet of the chip. The microfluidic patterns were designed by using AutoCAD (Autodesk, Inc.) and then printed on transparent plastics (Fig. 1a) as photomasks (purchased from CADart Washington, USA). The PEGDA brain cancer chip was fabricated by using the soft lithography method shown in Fig. 1a. PEGDA monomer (MW\u2009=\u2009750 Daltons, Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) was dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 40% (w/w) with the presence of photoinitiator 2-Hydroxy-4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone (PI). After mixing thoroughly, 1\u2009ml PEGDA monomer solution prepared above was pipetted in between two cover glasses for polymerization (top cover glass contained orifices for inlets and outlet, and the bottom cover glass had two spacers). Photo-polymerization was initiated with an Omnicure S2000 (320\u2013500\u2009nm, EXFO, Ontario, Canada) lamp at 100\u2009mW/cm2 (measured for 365\u2009nm) at a working distance of 16\u2009cm. After UV exposure, the PEGDA monomer solution was cross-linked into solid PEGDA hydrogel and integrated with the two cover glasses to form a chip. This chip was washed in PBS to remove uncross-linked liquid monomers and PI. Then, adhesive rings were sealed onto the orifices as inlet and outlet reservoirs.\nOptimization of the UV exposure time\n        Brain cancer chips with different thicknesses were prepared by adjusting the height of spacers between two cover glasses. Nine spacers from 200\u2009\u03bcm to 900\u2009\u03bcm in height were used and each chip with designed spacer was exposed under the UV light from 20\u2009seconds to 35\u2009seconds to optimize the suitable experimental conditions. PEGDA hydrogel failed to crosslink with insufficient exposure, while the extended exposure resulted in over-cross-linking that blocked the channels and the microwells. The increase of hydrogel layer thickness required longer UV exposure time.\nStability and leaking test of hydrogel microfluidics\n        Chicago blue (0.993\u2009mg, 0.001\u2009mmol, Sigma) was dissolved in PBS to a concentration of 5\u2009\u03bcM. One ml of Chicago blue solution was injected gradually from an inlet to observe flow in the microchannel. Excess liquid at the outlet was removed gently by pipet. Liquid leakage was confirmed by spread of Chicago blue out of the microchannel.\nComputational modeling\n        The microfluidic platform was modeled by COMSOL Multiphysics (www.comsol.com) to assess the channel composition. A 3D model was implemented to estimate the chemical-input ratio in different channels and their concentrations in the mixtures. For the multi-physics modeling, we used a modeled geometry with the same dimensions as our PEGDA hydrogel platform. FITC solutions at concentrations of 50\u2009\u03bcM and 0\u2009\u03bcM were injected into the left and right inlets, respectively. Assuming creeping flow and a stationary solver, the fluid concentration rates in the microwells along the channels were estimated using the incompressible Stokes equations:\n        \n          \n            \n          \n        \n        where \u03c1 is fluid density, u is the local velocity, p is the pressure (Pa) and \u03bc is the fluid viscosity. Diffusion constant was set to 2.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221210. A no-slip condition was imposed on the capillary walls, with zero pressure at the outlet, while fluid concentration at inlets were set to 10\u22125\u2009\u03bcM and 0\u2009\u03bcM, respectively. Hypothesizing that the flow rates are given and the viscosity is the same everywhere in the hydrogel microfluidics, the concentrations of FITC reduced gradually from the left to the right channels. Channels 1 and 2 were measured at 48\u2009\u03bcM, revealing that the ratio of the mixture between two solutions from left and right inlets was 96:4. In channels 3 and 4, 71% of the chemical in the solution mixture came from the solution injected through the left inlet. This ratio continued to decline to 35:65 in channels 5 and 6 and reached the ratio of 4:96 in channels 7 and 8 (see Supplementary Fig. S1). This shows that the chemical composition in individual channels and microwells can be estimated for drug screening, and applied to predict the combinatorial drug treatment.\nCharacterization of diffusion\n        Eosin (0.65\u2009mg, 0.001\u2009mmol, Sigma) was added to 100\u2009ml of PBS to a final concentration of 10\u2009\u03bcM. Chicago blue 5-\u03bcM and Eosin 10-\u03bcM were injected simultaneously into two outer inlets (Fig. 2d). The color appearances in channels change from distinct red (left) to blue (right). For further investigation of the solution gradients in the channels, two 200-\u03bcl solutions of 10\u2009\u03bcM FITC and PBS were injected concurrently into two outer inlets (Fig. 2e). The fluorescent intensities of FITC in the channels were quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) and are shown in Fig. 2e.\n        A 200-\u03bcl solution of 10-\u03bcM FITC was injected into the center inlet and channels containing fluorescence were observed under an Olympus fluorescence microscope. Time-lapse images were taken at 15\u2009sec, 1\u2009min, 3\u2009min, 5\u2009min, 10\u2009min, 15\u2009min, 20\u2009min and 30\u2009min (Fig. 3a). The fluorescent intensities were quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). A similar experiment was repeated to investigate the diffusion of DAPI (a low molecular weight molecule) in hydrogel platform. To verify the microfluidics platform\u2019s tunable chemical release, 1\u2009ml solution of FITC 10\u2009\u03bcM was injected into a channel (300\u2009\u03bcm width) with a microwell (1000\u2009\u03bcm diameter). Video was taken by time-lapse imaging by an Olympus fluorescence microscope for 1\u2009min. Time-lapse images were taken at different time points (1\u2009min, 3\u2009min, 5\u2009min and 10\u2009min) to quantify the diffusion of FITC to hydrogel from the microwell. Next, 1\u2009ml PBS was inserted to remove all FITC solution in the microwell. Video and time-lapse images were recorded (Fig. 3c). The fluorescent intensities were quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health).\nPreparation and culture of GBM cells\n        The U87 cells were cultured in cell culture medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 100\u2009U/ml penicillin and 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml streptomycin. All cells were manipulated under sterile tissue culture hoods and maintained in a 95% air \u22125% CO2 humidified incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The U87 cells were plated at a concentration of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml in 10-cm diameter tissue culture dishes and were passaged every 3 days at a subculture ratio of 1:4. After trypsinization and centrifugation, the U87 cells were collected and calculated using a hemacytometer (Hausser Scientific, 1483). To test cell capture efficiency in different designs of microchannels and microwells, the cell suspensions were diluted with the cell medium to prepare exact concentrations (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml) and seeded into the microfluidic device from the center inlet. Cell capture videos were taken by time-lapse imaging using Olympus fluorescence microscope (see Supplementary Video 3). Extra cells in the microchannels were removed by adding 1\u2009ml fresh medium twice. In addition to the microfluidic geometry, the microchannel and microwell dimensions play an important role in achieving high cell capture efficiency.\n        To optimize a proper cell seeding concentration, a series of cell concentrations of U87 cells (0.01\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml, 0.05\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml, 0.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml, 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml and 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml) were injected (100\u2009\u03bcl) into the center inlet. The cells aggregated to form cancer spheroids and were cultured in the microfluidic microwells for 7 days; medium was changed every 24\u2009hours by removing 500\u2009\u03bcl of solution from the outlet, and adding 500\u2009\u03bcl of fresh growth media into the inlets. Time-lapse images were taken by fluorescence microscope to monitor the cancer spheroid growth. The Live/Dead Cell Viability Assay Kit was performed to measure the U87 cell viability in the microfluidic microwells. The kit, containing calcein AM (2\u2009\u03bcg/ml in PBS) and ethidium homodimer (4\u2009\u03bcg/ml in PBS) reagents, was prepared as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The prepared Live/Dead solution was dropped into the center inlet on the hydrogel microfluidics, and was incubated with cells in the microfluidic microwells for 30\u2009minutes and the images were captured. Green fluorescence was measured due to the calcein AM reaction from viable cells and damaged cell membranes were stained red due to their reaction with ethidium homodimer.\nCombinatorial drug screening\n        Cancer spheroids were formed and cultured for 7 days. On the first day of dual-drug treatment, Pitavastatin (10\u2009\u03bcM, 100\u2009\u03bcl) and Irinotecan (100\u2009\u03bcM, 100\u2009\u03bcl), prepared in Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline (PBS), were injected into the two inlets (Fig. 5a), and the hydrogel microfluidic platforms were cultured and maintained in a 95% air-5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The growth media was exchanged every other day by removing 500\u2009\u03bcl of solution from the outlet, and adding 500\u2009\u03bcl of fresh growth media into the inlets. Time-lapse images were taken from Olympus fluorescence microscope at day 1, day 4 and day 7 of dual-drug treatment to observe the efficiency of the drugs on cancer spheroids (Fig. 5b). Cells from each microwell were harvested and checked for cell viability on days 1, 4, and 7 after drug administration. Each microchannel was cut from the hydrogel platform and the cells were harvested to check cell viability. Cells were washed twice with PBS and mixed with an equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue for 3\u2009minutes. The unstained (viable) and stained (lysed) cells were counted using a hemacytometer.\nTypan blue staining and quantitative characterization\n        Trypan blue staining was used to check cell viabilities on day 4 after drug administration in the brain cancer chip. Cells were washed twice with 200\u2009\u03bcl PBS injected from inlets. Next, 200\u2009\u03bcl of 0.4% trypan blue was added and the chip was incubated for 3\u2009minutes. The unstained (viable) and stained (lysed) cells were observed under Olympus fluorescence microscope.\nAdditional Information\n      How to cite this article: Fan, Y. et al.
