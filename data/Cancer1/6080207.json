    "title": "Glycosylation alterations in lung and brain cancer",
    "abstract": "Alterations in glycosylation are common in cancer and are thought to contribute to disease. Lung \ncancer and primary malignant brain cancer, most commonly glioblastoma, are genetically \nheterogeneous diseases with extremely poor prognoses. In this review, we summarize the data \ndemonstrating glycosylation is altered in lung and in brain cancer. We then use specific examples \nto highlight the diverse roles for glycosylation in these two deadly diseases and illustrate shared \nmechanisms of oncogenesis. In addition to alterations in glycoconjugate biosynthesis, we also \ndiscuss mechanisms of post-synthetic glycan modification in cancer. We suggest that alterations in \nglycosylation in lung and brain cancer provide novel tumor biomarkers and therapeutic targets.\nKeywords\nLung cancer; Glioblastoma; GBM; Glycosylation in cancer; SULF; HSPG; HPSE; Biomarker\n1.",
