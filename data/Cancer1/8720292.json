    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive central nervous system cancer with a dismal prognosis. \nThe standard of care involves surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but \nfive-year survival is only 5.6% despite these measures. Novel therapeutic approaches, such as \nimmunotherapies, targeted therapies, and gene therapies, have been explored to attempt to extend \nsurvival for patients. Nanoparticles have been receiving increasing attention as promising vehicles \nfor non-viral nucleic acid delivery in the context of GBM, though delivery is often limited by low \nblood-brain barrier permeability, particle instability, and low trafficking to target brain structures \nand cells. In this review, nanoparticle design considerations and new advances to overcome nucleic \nacid delivery challenges to treat brain cancer are summarized and discussed.\nKeywords\nNanoparticles; Biomaterials; Gene delivery; RNA delivery; BBB crossing; Targeted delivery; \nGlioblastoma; Intracellular delivery\n1",
