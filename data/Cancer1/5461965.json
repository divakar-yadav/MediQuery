    "abstract": "Recent genome-wide studies of malignancies of the central nervous system (CNS) have \nrevolutionized our understanding of the biology of these tumors. This newly gained knowledge \nprovides a wealth of opportunity for biomarker driven clinical research. To date, however, only \nfew of the available molecular markers truly influence clinical decision-making and treatment. The \nmost widely validated markers in neuro-oncology presently are: 1) MGMT promoter methylation \nas a prognostic and predictive marker in glioblastoma, 2) co-deletion of 1p and 19q differentiating \noligodendrogliomas from astrocytomas, 3) IDH1/2 mutations, and 4) select pathway-associated \nmutations. This article focuses on currently impactful biomarkers in adult and pediatric brain \ncancers and it provides a perspective on the direction of research in this field.\nKeywords\nBiomarker; glioma; glioblastoma; medulloblastoma; co-deletion of 1p/19q; MGMT promoter \nmethylation; IDH mutation; BRAF mutation\nClinical Biomarkers in Primary Brain Cancers: State-of-the-art Snapshot\nThe past two decades have provided a wealth of new knowledge on the biology and \npathophysiology of primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS), largely catalyzed \nby genome-wide studies that unveiled the genomic landscape of these malignancies.
